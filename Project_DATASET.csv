Kaaba,Sacred & Religious Sites,5,en,Security police is extremely rude to Haji’s specially the non arabic speaking ones. They can blame and push anyone and no one to ask. I understand their job is tough but by no means they should be rude and judge people. In an effort to touch the Holy Kaaba they would allow sisters take all the spots and if any non arab would like to be close to Kaaba the police would accuse and push them away plus would make very hurtful comments. I have decided not to do tawaf on the ground floor mataaf now.,"Kaaba is beautiful place only marred by some of the people that visit and more important the poor behavior of the guards towards people who are not Arabs. 
Have observed guards man handling individuals unnecessarily and are  very condescending and arrogant while being ignorant at the same time. They treat people as with no respect and believe they can treat visitors how they want.
On reflection they earn 8/hr so probably quality of staff and training is probably an indicator.
A very disturbing experience 
NS",,"This was my first experience to Kaaba / Makkah with disabled child age 8. Electric scooter provided by Masjid Al Haram authorities on the third floor made it easy to do tawaf and saee with child. The child was completely disabled. The Electric scooter/wheelchair is completely free for the disable person & carer. But rented for normal person with reasonable price. Double and single seat scooter are available. I decided to use the double seat and I hold the child at the same time drive the scooter. Its easy to drive. You can take the partner or assistance aswell. The staff can look after your own special chair and belonging in room, and you can take it back when you finished.
There are wheelchair friendly entrance ramps from outside Masjid Al Haram which take you straight to rental point.
Or you may ask the security/cleaning staff for the scooter hiring point.
Ouside Masjid Al Haram I found it a bit difficult to go around with disable child in her own wheelchair due to lake of wheelchair/ramp accessable vehicle. But still to keep my visit live& healthy I have hired several times 7-8 seater taxi or local drivers, in which the driver folded the back seats and we had to pick up the child inside the wheelchair to put it at the back of the car. which were obviously not comfortable at all. As the height of wheelchair and the car roof just 3-4 inches. 🥲
As my child is completely wheelchair bound, and has her own orthopedic approved wheelchair, So i can not use other chair. when we disembarked the plane in Jeddah the airport  staff refused to give our chair at the plane door, as normally travelling rest of the world they make an arrangment of our own wheelchair at the plane step. But in Saudi Arabia the supervisor mentioned that Saudi’s customs rules are different from the rest of the world 🤔, After long typical worst style argument they agreed that i hold the child and sit on one of the aiport provided wheelchair which were so small, wasn’t comfortable at all. and their staff push the chair to take the metro to the exit/luggage area, where i found my own wheelchair.
But overall the trip was good.

Umrah : Tawaf and Saee with partial physically disabled parents ","Well, we planned to do the pilgrimage and we did it, it was awesome to be there and finally see the Kaaba with our own eyes, very impressive and we were very happy to be there, The only thing that I think the people that runs this place have to correct is to give training to the people that works here, I saw them talking to the visitors with no good manners, they yell to the visitors and most of them do not speak english, so those workers have to be trained on behavior towards the visitors.

E' in corso un'opera di riqualificazione e valorizzazione. Muoversi nel quartiere è assolutamente sicuro, anche la sera. Ci sono dei tour guidati ma si può fare tranquillamente sé.
Suggerisco di farsi portare con il taxi presso una delle antiche porte, ad esempio la Baab Makkah, e da lì costruirsi un tour a piedi che preveda la visita alle case storiche (Matbouli House, Nassif House, Sharbatly House) della Al Ma’amar Mosque e dell'adiacente Souq Al Alawi. Grazioso anche l'edificio dell'Historical Nights Cafè, di cui non so recensire la ristorazione non avendo consumato. Tardo pomeriggio e sera il momento migliore per la visita, sia per le teperature sia per la possibilità di assaggiare lo street food locale, molto interessante e difficile da trovare in altro modo, visto che la gran parte dei ristoranti della città sono fast food o di cucina estera.

Great Mosque of Mecca,Points of Interest & Landmarks,5,en,,,"They really need to do something about the pushing, elbowing, shoving and the racism. Even at a holy place like THIS people don't want to pray properly. Do they really think their prayers will be answered if they do evil during salat? Laughing,  joking, not praying, with cell phones everywhere, it's just wrong. Deplorable behavior. You're not even supposed to have cell phones doing this so idk what kind of crazy that was anyway. They make it like a game or a joke. It's not. No food outside the haram unless you want to walk to the food trucks and idk whose feet can handle more walking when you are done with safaa and marwah.

People don't know how to use the escalator because they DON'T have them in their home country and they freak out and fall and get stuck in the teeth with all these long clothes just to get to the bathroom with no toilet paper anywhere.

I wanted to do it right before Ramadan so first few days in March 2024 were the best option. 
The city was closed for non-Muslims for centuries, but a few years ago restrictions were relaxed and visiting the city also became possible for those confessing other religions. It’s still forbidden to enter the Prophet’s Mosque (An Masjid an Nabawi) though, but walking the area around it is allowed and there is plenty to see!! 
Medina is a second most important city for Muslims after Mecca. Prophet’s burial site is actually in Medina in haram area within Masjid an Nabawi. 
Getting to the mosque and the whole haram (forbidden area) by taxi from Medina airport takes about 30 minutes and costs 90 SAR (please only use the official taxi companies), there are a few of them at the airport. 
Haram area is very, very crowded due to being a pilgrimage destination. There are worshippers literally from all around the world. 
Taking pictures is allowed but a friendly piece of advice - please only use a smartphone for that! Big cameras are not welcomed. I was told by the guard in a very rude way to hide the camera, but still managed to make some great photos using an iPhone. 
Anyway, it was my fifth trip to Saudi Arabia and I’m glad I’ve finally visited Medina. 
The only con during that trip was the disgusting behaviour of guards and the police near the mosque. Their rude and unprofessional attitude towards pilgrims is absolutely unacceptable. Since Saudi Arabia is now open for tourism, police and guards, especially in the tourist spots, need to be taught some good manners and develop proper communication skills. 
But still, I highly recommend Medina to all adventurous travellers like me!",this is the second largest mosque after Mecca. I had to hunt around to find the Arabic name for the Prophet's Mosque to write a review. Muhammed is buried here. The ground is spread over 20 some acres.

When we were there and watched the pilgrims from lots of different countries enter the mosque we were truly in awe of the masses that seemed never ending.

I was travelling with tree kids and had 5 bag allowance yet I only had 3 bags with me. Either way no one cared nor wanted to help. Supervisor was useless kept saying sorry pls book with SPL. I had a flight to catch with in 24hrs from Jeddah but they don’t care. At the same time many other families with bigger bags were able to get thru as they spoke in Arabic.

The train itself is fast, clean, and comfortable, making travel between cities like Makkah, Madinah, and Jeddah a breeze. It’s perfect for anyone looking to travel efficiently and in comfort. The convenience it provides is unmatched, and I highly recommend it for its modern design and smooth operations.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. The customer service and app functionality need attention. The app often crashes during the payment process, which makes booking a frustrating experience.

話した来場者は、公式サイトが案内している数種類のパッケージツアー(往復のエアチケット・空港までの送迎・ホテルかキャンピングカー・遺跡観光を含む)の参加者か、旅行会社が提供しているツアーの参加者でした。ガイドがついていたり、首から下げているチケットの種類でもわかりました。それ以外は、現地サウジアラビア人の家族が自家用車で訪れていました。個人の外国人観光客はほぼ見掛けませんでした。日本の旅行会社のツアーで参加しましたが、プロに任せていても、急なスケジュール変更があったり、現地からの回答を得るのにとても時間が掛かるので大変と聞いていました。よって現地側が個人客からの問い合わせに対して、まだ十分に対応できる環境ではないのかと思われます。
現地ガイドが同行していたので、Winter Parkでの適切なチケットの入手や、移動のたびにシャトルバスの全体の状況を確認してもらうことで、効率よく観光することができました。サウジアラビアでの観光は、突然状況が変わることがよくあり、現地での人脈や調整力がある方と行動しないと希望しているものは観られないと思いました。

”Winter at Tantora”では、砂漠と現代アート(Contemporary Art)が融合しており、古代遺跡や美しい景色を楽しむだけでなく、砂漠でのエコトレイルやポロ、Ziplineなどのアクティビティ、さらにギネスにも載った世界最大の鏡張りホール「Maraya Concert Hall」での有名ミュージシャンの日替わりコンサート、気球などのフライト、Michelin星付きシェフの食事など、魅力的なイベントがたくさん用意されていました。

この公園には仮設の建物が並びます。チケット売り場、ファーストフード(AL BAIK・Baskin-Robbins・Burger King・Tetra Pizza・Starbucks・BANANAZ・Your Burger・Shrimp Ship・BQ・Dunkin' Donuts)、トイレなどがあり、憩いの場となっていました。日中は暑いので、数少ないパラソルが人気になります。

公園の北側には、仮設の駐車場があります。遺跡へはシャトルバスで移動します。公園が起点となっていて3ルートありましたが、我々はグループだったので、状況でスケジュールや行き先が変わっていました。週末はバス以外に「Uber Vintage」というLand Roverでの移動もできるようでした。公式サイトのパッケージツアーのPlatinum・Diamond・Diamond Plusはシャトルバスでなく、専用のSUV車が手配されるようです。パッケージツアーは写真以外のコースも公式サイトには載っていました。

Al Ahsa Mall,Shopping Malls,4,en,"I lived in Al-Ahsa for 2 years.  Another reviewer noted that this is the best mall in Al-Ahsa, which, in fact it is-but believe me, that is not saying much.  No music plays due to local customs and the restaurants, cafes and stores are all in run-down condition.  If you are new to KSA, as woman, you should know that you cannot ry clothes on in a store-you must buy them and take them to the closest bathroom (or go through the bother of taking them all the way home).  Because of this, you MUST find out the return or exchange policy of each store, as in KSA they tend to be much more limited than most countries (exchange only, or return in 3-7 days with receipt).  In the end, although many people I worked with would go as something to do, I stopped going unless I really needed something.  Also, there are no cab ranks,  and if you find a cab be prepared to pay too much. Make plans in advance to get picked up and know what the price will be.

The Okto Restuarant was an excellent choice to have dinner under moonlight. Thew view of al Ula from that Hight was breathtaking ",,,"The road to this viewpoint begins at the roundabout at the western end of Winter Park. It is a paved road in perfect condition which, climbing rapidly in its central part, in 17 km leads to a car parking next to the observation point.  Already during the ascent of the road the landscape of the Haraat Nature Reserve impresses with its beauty and the area is used for some adventure sports. The road then becomes flat along the rocky desert top of the mountain. After leaving the car in the car parking (there is a toilet there), you can proceed on foot down a staircase while the restaurant is on the left. At the end of the staircase you reach the true extremity of the mountain and therefore the real view point and from here the view of Al Ula is fantastic. It seems to observe the town and the surrounding desert areas of mountains separated by flat sandy areas as if you were in a helicopter. The extensive green area of the oasis immediately makes us understand why this area had been inhabited since very ancient times. The best time to visit Harrat is before sunset, when the reddish mountains have brighter colors, and the fact that the road starts from Winter Park helps this choice (we started our visit from the car park after Dadan's afternoon visit). The restaurant, from which music spread, was very busy although we didn't stop having other dinner plans. If you visit Aula it is definitely recommended to visit this viewpoint","it's quite a drive to the top (and back down, of course) to the viewpoint that is about 4,000 feet up.

Jabal Thawr,Mountains,5,en,,,,,"This is the cave that the prophet (saw) and his companion (ra) escaped to save their lives while being chased by trackers. It’s a steep mountain. Anyone with back problems of any kind or mobility concerns should not attempt this mountain. It takes 2 hours for an able bodied person to climb and up to 4 hours for anyone else. Rocks are steep and the journey is treacherous winding up the mountain. You are constantly near to cliff edges there are no barriers to stop you falling so you must have good treads on your shoes to grip. You go up and down the same way. Many people will be using the same route as you. There are small hut shops dotted along the route so you can buy water and snacks if yours run out. I highly recommend a sugar fix maybe juice or chocolate to normalise your blood pressure for when you reach the top. There is a snack hut at the top. And no there are no toilets along any of the route. When you reach the top access to the small cave is tiny. Only a few people can fit. There will be a small queue for those wanting to offer prayers inside the cave. Coming down is harder than upwards because gravity will make you go faster. Many people fall and slip on the gravel on the way down. Take it slow. Don’t try and be fast, or smart. You cannot outwit nature. I saw people with diabetes, high blood pressure, old age, mobility issues, cry tears of pain and exhaustion having come so far and have to turn back because the physical pain was just too much to bear. If you have to walk a lot the next day then this uphill climb is not for you. It will leave you exhausted, tired, and ladies will get swollen ankles and feet. Go with a positive mindset. Take it very slow. Good grip shoes or trainers. Take snacks and liquids. Set aside at least 3 to 4 hours uphill. And 2 hours downhill.

Umrah Limo,Taxis & Shuttles,4.5,en,"This is the most disgusting car company I have had to deal with in my life!

Well in advance (actually 5 months back) I booked and fully paid a round-trip starting on the 30th March 2024 from Jeddah Int'l Airport to Mecca Hotel, on 11th April from Mecca Hotel to Madinah Hotel and finally on 13th April from Madinah Hotel to Jeddah Int'l Airport, all paid for a GMC 2024 vehicle (superior price compared to other vehicles!).

A couple of days before 30th March, Mr Saeed (Manager) and his lady colleague, Ms Sobha, sent me a WhatsApp msg saying that the GMC 2024 got a sudden breakdown (!) and that they could offer me a Hiace or a Staria vehicle. I objected but they told me that I could cancel and get a refund if I wished (2 days before my journey starts!). I finally accepted knowing that I wouldn't have time to arrange for another transport. Finally, the Hiace picked me and my family up at the airport. The van was very dirty and bad-smelling. Moreover, the driver was eternally on his mobile phone (I don't know if this is allowed in Saudi Arabia?!)

I finally learned from Mr Akeel (their Operations Manager) and another driver (Mr Aftab) that the GMC (new) never got a breakdown, it was used for another trip on that day (surely one that brought much more profit to the company!)

For my trip from Mecca Hotel to Madinah Hotel, this was another (more or less the same) story. Initially, the GMC was not available and they proposed an old Chevrolet. After fierce complaint, finally the GMC was made available again to me! The journey was ok but that driver was similar to the other one. He even had one leg crossed on his seat and let go the vehicle at its own pace (around 80kph), even if the speed limit was either 120 or 140kph. He was more concentrated on his phone calls! Even if I complained to him once, he stopped for 5 mins but could not bear to hold anymore and he retarted again!

For my final trip from Madinah Hotel to Jeddah Int'l Airport, having warned Mr Saeed and Mr Akeel about the driver, I made a nice trip, even reaching the destination 40 minutes in advance, the driver having driven the car normally and not speaking eternally on the phone!

Riyadh Golf Club,Golf Courses,4.5,en,,Great course set up I good condition. Especially for the fee. The one negative thing and it’s major is CARTS!!!! They either don’t have enough carts or don’t want to use the ones they have. If you book a tee time after 9am on the weekends expect to sit and wait for at least 30 minutes past your tee time to maybe get a cart. They won’t allow you to walk the course because they say it slows down play. Play is definently not back to back because you can’t get out near on time. I would rate this location higher because of the course layout but having to wait this darn past your tee time is horrible.,"The Riyadh Golf Club is a desert experience LIV golfers might enjoy. This layout , one of 3 courses in Riyadh, is moderately easy if you can avoid the giant bunkers around every green. Botched drives land in the desert hardscape then bounce onto lush green fairways. It's sort of like Scottish Highland Golf but in the desert. Greens are generally even but slow. There is a small lake - yes a lake - in the desert. During our mid-day round there were many maintenance workers on the course with high end golf course machinery. Unfortunately, beyond the fairway fences are ugly wastelands and dump sites. 
The Club House has limited food and of course no alcohol or beer. It caters to parties and events. None of the staff we met in the pro shop or the Club House plays golf. 
There is an excellent driving range and practice area. 
Saudi Arabia is trying to make a major foray into the golf business with its investment in the professional LIV golf tour. Saudi leadership says it wants to introduce its citizens to golf. The day we played, the course was not crowded. The players were mostly foreign businessmen and their wives. Many of the caddies and maintenance workers were migrants from South East Asia. 
After our round, we had a coke on the patio watching several groups of Saudi women in full niqab come to the patio, order a coke, look at the golf activity, then leave. One hopes there is a future for golf in the Kingdom. 
","RGC is a well maintained golf course North of Riyadh. It has a great design and it could easily be the top rated course in the country. However, they would need to improve some of their rough areas with more sod, add ball cleaners to each hole, and add GPS to their new golf carts. Also provide towels for each player when they pick up their golf carts and you have a world class golf course!","
I had the pleasure of visiting Riyadh Golf Club during my trip to Riyadh, and I must say it exceeded all my expectations. This hidden gem for golf enthusiasts offers an exceptional experience that is worth every moment.

The first thing that caught my attention was the breathtaking scenery surrounding the course. The well-maintained fairways, adorned with palm trees and vibrant flowers, created a picturesque backdrop that made each swing feel like a dream. The course layout was intelligently designed, offering a perfect balance of challenging holes and enjoyable gameplay for golfers of all skill levels.

Upon arrival, I was warmly welcomed by the friendly and attentive staff at the elegant clubhouse. The facilities were top-notch, providing a comfortable environment for golfers and visitors alike. The pro shop was well-stocked with a wide range of golfing equipment and apparel, ensuring that every golfer's needs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293995-d15668484-Reviews-Riyadh_Golf_Club-Riyadh_Riyadh_Province.html,,,+966 55 739 9900,"King Abdulaziz Rd, Riyadh 11671 Saudi Arabia",http://riyadhgolf.com/en/,10

Just go to Mount Harrat viewpoint to see the extent of Al Ula oasis. The presence of palm trees makes this place relatively cool and pleasant to walk around. For this reason, walking trails (to which different names have been given) have been created, and which network run through a large part of the oasis. Well indicated by the presence of signs, these trails can be accessed from several points in Al Ula, from the Old Town to Dadan. We parked the car at the oasis car park which can be reached by leaving the route 375 in front of the Old Town, turning right (if you go north) into the only unpaved road that enters the oasis (car parking GPS: 26.627044, 37.916876). Alternatively, you can park at Old Town Nord Parking or, if you find space, at Dadan. Walking along these paths you can see the old houses (largely destroyed by time) where the ancient inhabitants of the Old Town came to live in the hot summer, while some cultivation activity is still present. Even if each trail is mostly under palm trees, a cap and sunscreen are highly recommended in addition to a bottle of water. We only walked part of the trails in the afternoon and we found this activity pleasant and interesting.","Right through the valley in Al Ula it is green with date palms and various other crops.
In amongst this they have established a signposted walking trail where you stroll through the oasis and see how they grow the date palms and also get a glimpse into village life Saudi style.

This lounge is easy to find and is quite large, not like in the old South Terminal at Jeddah International Airport. 
This is a true International Business Class Airport Lounge with all of the amenities that any other International Airport would have, plus a few more. 
I like the idea of a “Live Cooking Station” and each time there I have really enjoyed the food.
Plus there are many break-out areas where you can enjoy peace-and-quiet. 
Finally, one new item I hadn’t seen before in any International Airport Business Class Lounge is a “Robotic Beverage Server”, which goes around one of the large break-out areas. Very, very unique!
All-in-all, trust me as I know that you will really enjoy the Al Fursan Business Class Lounge located in the new Terminal One of Jeddah International Airport. 
","What an absolute delight it was being able to experience the Al Fursan lounge at Jeddah’s new King Abdulaziz International Airport.
The facilities provided are really fantastic. 
The design of the lounge is excellent. There are lots of different areas and places to sit and relax. There are also sleeping booths and great washrooms and showering facilities.
There are plenty of places for charging your phone / computer etc and there are even large iPads available for your use. There are also a lot of different newspapers and magazines to read.
It’s the food and drink stations that really stand out though. Many of them are cooking stations meaning that the food is chosen by you and freshly prepared by them, while you wait. 
There are pizza stations, omelette stations, sandwich stations to name but a few.
There are also places to help yourself to a drink or use the barrister station. I particularly loved this one. The choice of drinks on offer were great. My barrister made a delicious latte. I also ordered a raspberry mojito from here and it was really tasty (non alcoholic of course) 
There’s also a great dessert station where all manner of fancy and really delicious sweet treats are on offer, including big pieces of chocolate.

Although he set us up with a very expensive personal driving service (USD 400/day), we accepted it as we just wanted to have a good time on vacation. We had hired a personal English speaking driver. We got the opposite. The driver had no understanding of our questions, and was haggling with us to pay him $40 to take us to our hotel, while Meteb was unreachable. We didn’t pay him because our agreement was per day, not per leg of the trip. He took us back to the airport then where we rented a car for $100 for two days and ended up being just fine.

Umrah Taxi,City Tours,3.5,en,"Booked with Umrah Taxi based partly on TA reviews.  It apears that many people have very good experiences but ours was absolutely terrible.   The only good things I can say is that the price was transparent and the driver did arrive on time for pick-up.

Umrah taxi says on its website ""We are an organization that values, excellence...""  and has ""Professional Drivers"".   Based on our experience and on our driver, these are decriptions are not true.   

Here is what our driver did.
1.  He drove dangerously and frequently took both hands off the streering wheel - even at full highway speeds (140 kph).
2.  He kept on using the mobile phone repeatedly, including sending a text WhatApp message.  Suggesting to him that this was dangerous had not effect on him at all.
3.  He drove very aggresively and narrowly missed other vehicles on several occassions, even on the highway.  This included tailgating at full highway speed. He literally came with inches of other vehicles.  
4. He stopped twice for his own purposes and not once did he even have the decency to say how long he would be or even to ask us if we needed to stop for any reason or needed to get food etc on this over 4 hour journey.
5.  For over an hour he kept noisily shelling seeds in his mouth and eating them.  Not only was the noise digusting and very irritating, it meant that he was only holding the steering wheel with one hand.  He only stopped eating seeds when we reached a checkpoint.
6.  On arrival, he opened the boot and that is all he did.  He left it for me to take the luggage out.

The only thing that prevented me from swearing at him were that we had just done Umrah.  I paid him the full agreed amount even though he did not deserve it.

I am providing this driver's details so that others can beware if they come across him and that Umrah Taxi can take action if it so chooses.  He is a young Pakistani called Nasrullah and his number is 058 112 96 95.

Based on our experience, there is no way I would possibly recommend Umrah Taxi.",In the past I used to book via this company. And they always used to came on time with clean cars. But my last experience was bad. They sent me an Makkah street taxi instead of their own company car. I also got 3 different plate numbers and was called by 2 different drivers which was very stresfull and confusing. I guess that last minute they decided and changed which car would come. I can't recommend this company with full trust anymore. If they are fully booked they will sent an street taxi without any notice beforehand.,"They’re a good company. That’s how they make their money. Of course they have to keep up with the competition. WARNING: Make sure you pay in SAR. Don’t pay in USD/GBP as they will rip you off in conversion rate and demand more money from you. I experienced this as I didn’t have enough SAR and when I tried to pay them in USD they took advantage of me. Also, I was disappointed to see that the (Muslim) driver didn’t pray any of the prayers the whole time he was with us. DANGER: The driver was on his phone the whole time from Makkah to Madinah and within Madinah tour. Very unsafe and dangerous.","Just book on their booking site umrah.taxi for the trip and will send the taxi for pickup at hotel. The taxi used is the Ijrah taxi.

Driver can speak english and easier to communicate.","Booked from UK, arrived in jeddah, driver found us.  He took us to our destination, stopped for prayers and comfort break.  A seamless esperance, highly recommended.

My advice is that if you do not have a Saudi Sim, get one at the airport so the driver can whatsApp you. To register to use free airport WiFi, you  need to be able to receive a text message.  Personally, think that's silly cos I've used free WiFi in other airports without the need tor them to send me a text message.

It's also a quiet place during week days. But, so pity, it's terribly dirty, plastics everywhere. Furthermore, many big sand dunes exist in SA, so this place is interesting if you stay in Riyadh only.","Saudi Arabia is still building out its tourism infrastructure and it is EXTREMELY difficult to book tours from the US currently. Accordingly, we choose to book with Saudi Arabia Tours when transiting through Jeddah for a cruise. There were definite pros and cons. 

The company does have decent information about their tours on their site along with the ability to book online; communication was mostly prompt and I appreciated their flexibility to change the date of our tour after we had to board our cruise early than anticipated. They did confirm pickup and I communicated with the guide via Whatsapp before my arrival; he met us right on time directly outside port customs. 

However, the guide was really more of a driver. He was a good driver and very obliging, but his English was not that strong and he wasn't able to provide much information about what we did see (the International City Museum, Al Balad Market, Al Shafi Mosque and the Corniche) or make any suggestions about what else we should see given that Al Balad was mostly closed and we could not enter the mosque. I will say that he recommended an excellent and affordable restaurant for lunch. 

Given that we paid close to $1,000 for our party of 3, this was not the level of service we were expecting.  The tour did include admission to the museum but otherwise did not offer much over booking a driver for a 7-hour day. I realize that tourism is still quite new in Saudi Arabia and it may cost a premium to book from the US but this seemed a bit steep. Overall, I think you can feel confident that Saudi Arabia Tours is a safe option to book, but you may want to do your own research around local sites and history in case a fully trained guide is not available.","Great outdoor activities, meet new friends, more ATV's to choose, the owner of the ATV's are very helpful in case you need help.","We have travelled for more than 400 KM from our current residence area just to reach this place.

Riyadh Hiking,Multi-day Tours,4.5,ja,"場所は素晴らしかったですが、ツアーは最悪でした。

まず、私達は集合場所で1時間ほど待たされました。理由を聞いても｢10分待て｣と言われるだけで、十分な説明はありませんでした。

それだけならツアーでは珍しくないですが、なんと目的地の滞在時間は10分しかありませんでした。
他の人は滞在しているのに私達だけです！

ディナーを予約していましたが、駐車場で、車の横で食べるだけで、景色はとても悪かったです。
料理はとても安っぽく、とても値段に見合った内容ではありませんでした。

後で分かったのですが、スタッフの手違いで、我々の車だけ早く帰る必要があったようです。

ツアーガイドには英語ができる人が少なく、状況を把握できたのは車が帰り始めた後のことでした。

景色は本当に素晴らしかったですが、その他の事は最悪で、お金を返してほしいくらいです。

とにかく、ツアーに参加する際は英語が話せるドライバーの車に乗ること、ディナーは付けないことを強くオススメします。","It pains me to write this poor review because the driver, Mohammed, was really wonderful.  He took care of us during the drive, cooked us excellent dinner and made us all feel welcome.  Unfortunately, his English wasn't great so we couldn't really converse.

My biggest complaint is with the gentlemen who arranged the tour.  When we booked, we EXPLICITLY asked  if we could pay with card, as the booking through the website didn't work  (There was even a disclaimer that foreign phone number may not work well with the booking login).  Answer was: NO PROBLEM.      
On the day, he forgot to bring the card machine and implied that his website worked for other people.  He took over my phone and I proved to him it DIDN'T work.  Apple pay function didn't work, card didn't work.  He wanted paypal but I have no account and refused to set up an account by providing my passport no. to some  website with non-English writing.  So he asked for cash.  I refused and wanted to cancel.  He said instead of cancelling, I could go ahead and he WOULD BE at the pick up point with the card machine...

You can guess.  He wasn't there.  Mohammed who couldn't speak English well said we could take cash from the ATM to pay him.  Well, they essentially forced us to pay CASH !  Unprofessional.  They should just have the guts to cancel us.    

Before anyone comes back with counter argument:  1.  I have screen shots of the confirmation that we can pay by card.  2.  the other tourists in our car have local numbers.  3.  some other booked through other platform, like Get Your Guide.  

We came from a similar tour in Abu Dhabi where everything was professionally organized.  I only could hope that with transformations in Riyadh, these stories would be something of a past as they improve their professionalism.  

Other than that, recommended to go to Edge of the World.  It's one of the most magical place I've been.  Go now, before it's crowded!   Just make sure NOT to book direct or have a local number.","Overall the trip was great. We got great photos and the edge of the world was very cool to visit. 

But it’s worth noting this isn’t a tour - it is a driver. The driver didn’t speak English and we didn’t learn anything. He just drove us near the location and pointed us where to walk. Also, they fit 7 people in a Chevy Tahoe. Two of us were unlucky to be in the back, where there is zero leg room and your knees are at chest level. Another car with a better third row would be a huge improvement. My legs and butt fell asleep in each direction from the lack of movement. 

But the company was very nice and friendly for pick up and for the dinner, which was rice, pasta, and chicken. If you book without dinner, you get home earlier (recommend that option). It was cheap and got me where I needed to go. I’d recommend it if you know what to expect.","The trip was well organized! Although we came on a gloomy day, the view was still worth it. I would have wanted to know more about the area, some facts or history. Ended the night with a lovely dinner set up although not sure if food was worth the extra 60 SAR but lovely experience nonetheless!",Faisal was an amazing guide and driver and the trip was fantastic! We set off in the afternoon and the drive was easy. The views at the edge of the world are truly breathtaking.

We visited markets, the old town of Riyadh, had lunch at a traditional restaurant and drove out to Ushaiqer. Our guide was friendly and funny, took lots of pictures for us and the day was good overall, but this company has a lot of opportunities for improvement. We had to ask all the questions because we got no history or information from our guide. He spoke very little English. For a tour as expensive as it was I expected a lot more learning and explanation of the places we were visiting. Food was good, snacks and water were provided which was nice.","Our tour included several nights in Riyadh, then a flight on to AlUla, for 2nights, followed by a drive to Tabuk for a flight to Jeddah for several nights.  We then flew to Abha early morning and back to Riyadh in the evening for our last night. 
Our driver guides were all very helpful and hospitable. We had Ahmed and Amaan in Riyadh, Ahmad in AlUla and Younas in Jeddah. Younas is a teacher with excellent English and a very good knowledge of the history and culture. He’s very good company and happy to spend time with us so we learned a lot from him. Thanks to all. 
One improvement could be to get guides to have our names on a board when meeting at airports. These are often vast places, extremely busy and not always possible to get Wi-Fi. Sometimes difficult to find the guide.
Otherwise a very good tour.","Saad was really a nice tour guide. 
He picked us up at the hotel and we started our tour by stopping at the supermarket to buy some drinks to keep us hydrated.

We were taken to a tent where we drank homemade Saudi coffee with dates and tahini sauce.

Then we had a squad tour time where we stopped to try out camel milk (way more light than cow milk)

By the end of the day we exchanged some nice information and we learn how rich is the Arabic culture in the Middle East.

We were eager to visit some of the holiest sites in Makkah and learn more about both the history and religious significance of the sites. Our driver- and I use that word intentionally- was just a driver. Aftab could not be less invested or interested in being a tour guide. From the moment we got into the car, he was on one personal call after another. He made no effort to give us any information regarding the sites, he barely mentioned names as he passed some of the sites. He didn’t even stop at all the listed sites of the tour. We had to persistently ask questions about where we were going and ask about the significance of the places but he was not able to provide us information. We asked questions to engage him but he continued to speak on the phone. We had to plead him to get closer to Jabal Al Noor- he was trying to show us from across the highway. We didn’t even see Jinn mosque, he sped through barely mentioning it. If you’re looking for an enlightening experience to learn more about the rich history or practices of Islam, steer clear. I’m sure there are better tour companies that can provide meaningful services ","The room, not too bad.

We went to the old part where there are some historic buildings with the typical windows and very short balconies and to the market.

A nice seaside village even if the most interesting part is represented by the boat tours.","All you need to know about Umluj. 😍

Our stay-🏚
We stayed in yanbu which is 2hours away drive from Umluj.
We booked @novotel_yanbu through booking.com for three nights.

Umluj Boat ride-🛥
We booked our ride from @umluj_serves. There are different rates  for different boats and yachts. You can choose your timings, we went from 9am to 1pm.
We were a group of 10 people and opted for this boat in frame and it costed us total sr1000 + sr130 (fruit basket) for 4 hours. 

Keep exploring for more boats as you can get cheaper ones too, we got to know about the cheaper ones after we had booked and did the advance payment. So keep contacting different boat guides. 

Activities-🚤
•If you're lucky then you can get to see dolphins, turtles and fish. Unfortunately we couldn't see dolphins or turtles.🐬🐢🐠
Tip- carry khubs or roti so that seagulls can come closer to you. 

• Our boat anchored  into the middle of the sea where there was shallow water and we stayed there for around 2 hours. It was definitely the best experience from the whole boat ride. Swimming, floating and relaxing and clicking pictures. All you could see was crystal clear water and beautiful shades of blue around till far. 
😍
• Fishing- none of us were interested in it so we didn't do fishing. 🐠

Definitely a mesmerising experience for sea lovers.❤❤❤",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g17792905-d21287972-Reviews-Umluj_Tours-Umluj_Tabuk_Province.html,,,+966 55 801 8938,"Olya St, Umluj 33511 Saudi Arabia",https://saudiarabiatours.net/umluj-tours/,4

After 3 hours of doing almost nothing we went to the beach. The place where we started is very difficult to start even for people with some experience (there were to many waves and rocks). I had to look after my friends who where too scared in that place, instead of enjoy. Finally the instructor decided to take us to the place of diving. I went down and waited there 15 minutes without doing nothing, waiting for the instructor who was dealing with my friends in the surface. My friends started to get panic, and many of them decided to cancel the diving. Finally a saw the instructor coming to me, I thought that my course where going to start, but the instructor told me that the dive was cancel. I went out and tried to talk to him, but hi took his belongings and run away inadvertently. We lost too much that day: we lost our time (1 out of 3 days), my friends will never try again because of this terrific experience, and we pay the most expensive 15 min diving in an ugly spot: 700SAR. I’ve chosen this place because they were SSI official, but next day I went to the ocean with an feelance instructor and I got so much more information and good experience. I hope the SSI asociation will review their agents. ","Boat trip was just a huge mess. Took almost 3 hours until the boat finally left the marina. It was overcrowded with about 50 snorklers and divers. Several tanks were not secured and they did not even bring enough for the number of divers. I was not asked for my certification or my diving experience, groups were put together randomly. The reef was quite disappointing and not worth the long boat ride. In more than 500 dives I have also never seen the guide using a scooter under water as he moves forward much faster than the group and the noise is scaring marine life away. The only highlight were some big curious silky sharks but I would not recommend snorkling there or let inexperienced divers go without any instructions on how to behave with these potentially dangerous sharks, especially being far away from shore. I would highly recommend more safety measures. The only positive point was that the crew, although apparently inexperienced and overstrained, was very friendly, tried to solve the problems and make the best out of the mess.",,"انا من محبين القوص تحس بالمتعة في اثناء ممترسة القوص والسباحة في البحر ولا ننساء الايتمتاع بالبحر على الشاطئ الجميل",اولا الغوص فعلا شي مختلف ورهيب. مرشد الغوص كان ممتاز ودلني على مختلف الكائنات المائية في البحر .معدات المركز نظيفة وحديثة. اسعار معقولة. تجربة الغوص كلفتني إجمالا ٥٠٠ ريال لكن تستاهل ,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295419-d9740183-Reviews-Al_Haddad_Scuba-Jeddah_Makkah_Province.html,39.058643,21.755066,+966 56 020 7606,Jeddah 23821 Saudi Arabia,http://haddadscuba.com/en/homepage/,38

Riyadh Off Road,"4WD, ATV & Off-Road Tours",4.5,en,"We were up to a bad start. The trip started half an hour late without any prior communication. In fact, we had to chase up the provider to get an answer 15 minutes after the trip was supposed to start that it will be late. Then, 7 people were put to an SUV for the 2+ hours drive. The back seat had NO leg room at all! Not little leg room but absolutely nothing. People who sat there had to have their knees up to their chest. That’s bot how to do it","I felt and still feel extremely disappointed by the way the tour operator treated me and my friend. We booked and paid for a tour on Viator site that was available that day. The tour was confirmed via an email but shortly after we got contacted by the tour operator saying that the tour (interestingly!) was not available that day. 

Clearly - as we learnt - that were not enough people so it was not valuable nor beneficial for the tour operator to take us there for the price of the group tour (75USD pp). We were offered to be taken there for additional 300SAR (75USD). Since it was our last day in Riyadh and we really wanted to do this, we agreed to pay extra as long as the tour operator is willing to go down with the price. He agreed and the price was lowered to 200SAR for the two of us. He also offered to pick us up from the hotel rather than from an agreed pick-up point. What he never mentioned was that the hotel pick-up would raise the price back to 300SAR so imagine the surprise we faced when we got into the car when we met the guide.  It’s a ‘dirty practice of ripping off tourists’ really. Something I despise and would never do myself to anyone while conducting business. 

We ended up paying 225 USD (for the two of us) for being taken to the site and nothing else. The guide barely spoke any English, did not say anything about the site, and we received two small bottles of water. Never seen let alone received any snacks. Totally not worth it. The guide wasn’t happy about taking us back to the hotel in central Riyadh either. He wanted to drop us off at Diriyah which is in the northern part of Riyadh and said we could take a taxi back from there. 

When I contacted the tour operator later on to share my thoughts and disappointment with him, he excused himself saying that the third party we booked with charges him 40% of the rate so he only gets 45USD of what we paid. He also said that petrol costs 250SAR for the tour. First, as a customer I don’t care about individual agreements with third party companies. I paid 75USD and that’s quite a lot for what it is. Secondly, the 250SAR for petrol is a lie. We stopped at a petrol station with the guide and he filled up the car for 100SAR which is 43 litres of petrol. 

If they know it’s a low season and there might not be enough people interested in the tour they should block the dates/times and be transparent about it.

Had I known this was going to happen, I would chosen a different tour operator that would be cheaper and where the dinner is included. This completely ruined my experience. I was annoyed from the minute we got into the car until we got dropped off at the hotel. Totally not worth it. It’s better to spend your money elsewhere. I would not recommend them to anyone let alone use them again myself.",,"Booked this as it was the cheapest available option on Tripadvisor. We went on a Tue at 14.30. The driver arrived to the designated parking lot at 14.40. We didn’t leave until 15.10, even though everyone seemed to be there already. We drove to the Al Manjour trail as the Edge of the World is currently closed for building a new tourist path there (this is not shown anywhere in the Tripadvisor description btw so bit of false advertising there). Driver plus 3 people in the car, which was on the old side but still comfortable. Once at the trail, the driver sent us ahead on the walk which we did there and back in less than an hour. By the time we got back, the driver set up a seating area by the car, with tea, coffee, dates, biscuits, crisps. Lounged there for another 90min before dinner was ready. Another two cars joined us for dinner. Rice, pasta with small pieces of chicken, leafy salad. Delicious although carb heavy. Did 10min of stargazing after dinner, then headed back to Riyadh. Arrived back at around 21.30.

Overall good experience. Nice views, relaxing day. Wish the driver walked with us and gave an actual tour, but it was still good.

Dive Point Jeddah,Scuba & Snorkeling,4.5,en,"Found this Dive Center to be highly unresponsive to the inquires sent to the Business WhatsApp Account on multiple occasions, as well as exploiting tourist’s lack of knowledge in the cost of diving by charging twice what was quoted from their competitors. 

Take my advice, if you want to scuba dive or learn how, go to someone who cares more than just about the profit they will earn off you. 

Was quoted 750 Saudi Riyal (aka. $200) for 2 shore dives off the resort beach. As a price comparison, this would have been the most expensive dives I would have done, only being surpassed by The Great Blue Hole in Belize (UNESCO World Heritage site) @$250 !

- Depois conhecermos a fazenda de camelos em um lugar imundo , sem possibilidades de montar , sempre com o motorista com pressa . Uma piada chamar aquilo de fazenda de camelos.  
- Nos quadriciclos , o local era sujo , muito sujo mesmo , com crianças andando , carros passando e outros em alta velocidade . Ficamos com medo e não fomos . Ficamos olhando apenas por uns minutos . 
- Nesta hora o motorista nos convidou a voltar , mas pedimos para nos deixar em Jeddah Corniche , foi negado . Depois pedimos pra deixar no Red Sea Mall , onde estávamos inicialmente e foi negado também por ser longe . Pedimos duas vezes sem resultado . 
- Desta forma , resumindo , saímos do Shopping às 3:40 , chegamos no deserto às 4:25 , ficamos 20 minutos na areia de Jeep , 15 minutos nos camelos e  15 minutos no quadriciclo olhando

Our driver was friendly and helpful, if not super-chatty, expert or with perfect English. We really appreciated the insight he was able to give us into Saudi life though. It was great to get up into the mountains, where the air is drier and in the evening much cooler. There are a number of areas in which Saudi tourism has still to optimise: the litter, the feeding of wild animals against the rules, the realisation that things which may appeal to Saudis might not have the same novelty to Europeans, and finally the cost. (Why does this very expensive trip cost twice as much for a couple as for one person, when the extra cost incurred by the company is negligible?) We did enjoy the trip as it enabled us to see things we could not have seen otherwise. We had a good Saudi meal at lunch time, and an excellent falafel at the end of the day. The cable car was peaceful and dramatic, the rose distillery was interesting, and it was nice to be able to walk around the public garden in Taif (unfortunately the many different trees are not labelled).

Ghars Well,Historic Sites,4.5,en,,,,"During our recent visit to Madina with family, we had the opportunity to visit the historic Ghars Well, in Arabic بئر غرس. This well holds great significance as it is where the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) once drank from and requested to be bathed with its water after his demise. It stands out as one of the few historical sites directly connected to the life of the Prophet Muhammad. The Ghars Well complex has undergone recent renovations, with upgrades to the outer enclosure walls, the addition of a small mosque to the north, and the installation of a small sabil (drinking water taps). For safety reasons, a metal grill now encases the well, preserving its historical and spiritual importance for Muslims. Convenient parking is available nearby, and informative hoardings provide visitors with photos and descriptions detailing the significance of this sacred place.","Arabia. It is considered one of the most important historical sites in the city and is revered by Muslims as a significant place in the early history of Islam.

The well is said to have been dug by the companions of the Prophet Muhammad and is believed to have provided them with water during their stay in Medina. According to Islamic tradition, it was at this well that the Prophet Muhammad and his followers took refuge during their migration from Mecca to Medina.

Aside from its historical significance, Ghar'a Well is also significant due to its architectural style and design. The well is made up of a series of interconnected underground chambers, which were designed to store water and protect it from the elements. The walls of the chambers are made of dressed stone and the well has a distinctive, domed roof that is made of brick.

Visitors to Ghar'a Well can still see the remains of the well and its surrounding structures, which have been partially restored in recent years. The site is open to visitors and is a popular destination for tourists and religious pilgrims alike.

In conclusion, Ghar'a Well is a unique and important historical site in Medina, Saudi Arabia, that has great significance for both its historical and architectural value. Its status as a place of refuge for the Prophet Muhammad and his followers during their migration makes it a revered and sacred site for Muslims, and its distinctive design and architecture make it a fascinating place to visit for visitors of all backgrounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298551-d25313546-Reviews-Ghars_Well-Medina_Al_Madinah_Province.html,39.60245,24.467213,+966 800 850 1526,"CJWG+3VG, Ali Ibn Abi Talib Qurban, Medina 42316 Saudi Arabia",http://welcomesaudi.com/,2

My Saudi Tours,City Tours,4.5,en,"Please do NOT use this company! They are scammers and we have had a terrible experience with them. I have lived in Saudi since 2014 and finally my family came to visit me for a holiday. We had no car and this company offered pick up from our location, they sent us an email and advertised a trip with a full itinerary, which looked really attractive, so we asked to proceed. 

Firstly they were extremely slow at confirming, only on the morning of the trip did they actually answer their phone or email despite me trying to contact them for two days.

Next a driver did pick us up from our location, no English, but used google translate and we managed. He stopped at a gas station and asked us for cash. We only had 250 sar which he wanted for petrol and somehow communicated this will be deducted from the price. This was not mentioned previously, but he obviously didnt have any money and we needed gas to get to the desert. He then sent a link and wanted the full amount paid. It was a substantial amount. We paid using the link in full as all the trips were pay upon booking.

When we arrived it was a lovely camp. It was actually a lovely evening. The problem was most of the itinerary was missing! There was no camel ride (my kids were absolutely devastated), no BBQ, no light games, no music, and no preparing the food in the traditional way. 

Due to the price we paid we asked for a partial refund as the advertised itinerary was completely missing from the trip.

Of course they disappeared from the face of the earth and we haven't been able to contact them since.

Extremely poorly run company, zero customer service.",,,"A really good way to spend the morning. We got picked up on time in a good vehicle with plenty of room. Arrived at the site after around an hour and a very brief intro to the quads and we were off. The time on the bikes was plenty and we were left to drive in dunes by ourselves.  After the ride there was a chance to sit on a camel for a short stroll guided by a staff member with a rope. On way back we stopped for a drink at Dunkin Donuts paid for us. Overall very good. Some potential improvements - optional helmet on the bikes, tidier dunes - lots of litter, a longer camel ride option over the dunes and finally a better local coffee shop - Dunkin is not good coffee!

Haya Tour,Sightseeing Tours,4,en,Very bad experience. I used to travel private boat. No boat server  proper time. No infomation centre,"We booked a 2 Nights trip to Farasan Island and we told Haya Tours to book the flight tickets so we booked the right flights against an extra fee. The Company double charged us for the fees, but when we told them that they had doublecharged us they returned the double fee at once. But we kept receiving e-mails from Saudia that Our flight tickets would be cancelled because they had not been paid, so that was annoying when we had paid for the tickets to Haya Tours before they were booked! But we had booked a 2 Nights tour, but we only got one night tour without any discount for the missing night. We were supposed to have left on Thursday night for Jizan and then take the free government Ferry to Farasan Island, but Haya Tour changed the Schedule so we left Riyadh at 04.50 and arrived Jizan at 6.40 a.m. The free Ferry to Farasan Island leaves at 7 a.m. and all passengers have to be on Board at 6.45 a.m.!!! It is very easy to see that it is not possible when the flight arrives at 6.40 a.m.! We were picked up at the airport by a driver who was friendly, but not able to communicate With the Group in English. He drove us to the Government Ferry which we could see departing the port. Then the driver drove us to a private port where it was possible to buy for a private boat to take us to Farasan Island. The driver said that we had to pay Rs 50,- each person for the private boat, and we found that was strange since it was Haya Tours responsibilty to get us to Farasan Island. We had to have 2 very strict Security Controls at the private port, - even my Box where I keep my sunglasses were opened, my Money purse was opened and gone through! Then the private port needed to have copies of Our IDs but did not have a photocopy machine so the driver had to drive to have that done while we were waiting in the heat for a while without getting any water. But the trip got much better when we arrived Farasan Island because we got a good driver and the boat trip was great. But we did not stay at the hotel we were supposed to stay at, - we were supposed to stay at a hotel on the Beach, while Our hotel was a 2 star hotel far from the Beach and With Garbage lying outside etc. But the hotel management was excellent, and the hotel manager fixed it so we got refunded the price of the private boat trip to Farasan Island. We also got a good sightseeing trip on Farasan Island on Saturday morning before lunch and taking the Government Ferry to Jizan. The driver picked us up, and we drove around and visited Jizan Heritage Village which was interesting before going to the airport. I really recommend a trip to Farasan Island which has a wonderful Ocean life With dophins, turtles, pelicans etc., but not With Haya Tour. When I pay for an expensive trip, I expect it to be of high quality without any problems at all! My husband and I could easily have flown to London and stayed there at a good hotel for 2 Nights, and it would have been cheaper than the price of this trip! I would think Haya Tours usually does a better job than on this trip, but unfortunately this was the first time we tried Haya Tours and on future trips I will prefer to try other tour operators than Haya Tours!","Haya Tour was kind enough to give up some of their 23rd September National Day holiday so that some of us foreigners could have a Riyadh Tour.

Later we saw Fort Mismak but NOT another landmark which we were also promised.","Whether you're a Saudi or an Expat, Haya Tour offers one of the few ways to experience Saudi Arabia and the region in ways that expand your contact with people you might not otherwise have a chance to meet.

88 Destinations,Multi-day Tours,4,en,"KSA review

The number one rule in business is meeting the expectations that you set. The February 2023 Heritage Tour didn’t do this. There were clues that something wasn’t right even before we all reached Saudi Arabia but I hoped that wasn’t indicative of what lay ahead. 

There’s a lot to see and do in Saudi Arabia but 88 Destinations made it impossible to relax and enjoy it. Constant delays, exceptionally poor organization and logistics, unkept commitments, a lack of local knowledge and poor communication contributed to an anxiety-inducing ‘holiday’. 

I took another company’s tour in Uzbekistan right after this and it was everything the 88Destinations tour wasn’t - efficient, with knowledgeable guides, and respectful of clients’ time and needs. 

Those of us on the Heritage tour began betting each day how late we would start and what the excuses would be. Each day finished a number of hours later than planned, leaving no time to recover. 

I and at least two other passengers were in frequent contact with the agency to request assistance. Instead of correcting the situation comprehensively and right away, half measures were taken and none of them lasted. They compensated through room upgrades and adding a stop or two but we wanted the tour we had paid a great deal of money to take. 

Several times passengers had to take matters into our own hands to make things happen. That simply should never have to happen.

Our tour coordinator, Abdullah, is a very nice man who seems to want the best for his clients. Others in the agency are similarly kind and decent people.

However, this company isn’t ready to do tours. They need to take the time to start over before accepting new clients.",,,Um espaço abandonado que passa agora por uma requalificação com objectivos turísticos bastante pertinentes.

Riyadh Tours,Multi-day Tours,4.5,en,,,,"I had to cancel my planned trip to Hong Kong due to the Coronavirus, leaving me with 2 weeks and the need for a Plan B. Saudi Arabia Tours helped me put together an itinerary that met my interests and enabled me to experience the country. I spent a few days in Riyadh, including a fantastic trip to the Edge of the World. Then i flew across the country to Jeddah and drove to Taif and Abha. The guides drove safely and were very accommodating — when we were unable to visit sites on the agenda due to closures, we worked together to come up with alternatives. We also stopped at random places on the road, like a camel milk market and a honey farm. Tourism in Saudi Arabia is in its infancy, so flexibility and an adventurous spirit are necessary. I was satisfied with my choice of 3-star hotels, which were pretty good for that part of the world and had decent breakfast buffets. I would encourage travelers to do their own research and visit places of interest that might not be on the set itineraries. Also, a highlight for me was meeting the extremely welcoming Saudi people, which i did on my own in the evenings. On the whole, i was happy with the services of Saudi Arabia Tours and had a wonderful time on my trip.",They have an on time response to queries. Rokaia their agent’s very helpful.

So why the one star?

I booked a spin-up dive package with the guy at the listed number, flew in from out-of-town, showed up on time (actually 15 min early) and not only was the staff in the dive shop not even aware of my booking, the instructor wasn’t there either.  The instructor no-call, no-showed on me; I was out the taxi fare to and from the resort.  To his credit, the on-duty person at the dive shop, was extremely professional and apologetic, and even refunded my resort access fee which I appreciated.  He put me in contact with the absent instructor who told me he had a vaguely-described emergency.  Stuff happens, I get it, but the impression I got from the call was that he had actually just forgotten me and had a scheduling conflict.  He called around trying to find another diver to go with me unsuccessfully.  The website says they have dive masters and instructors, plural, but no one was available.  I am extremely frustrated that I was not called ahead of time and told that they had to cancel; if they had I might have had time to book at another shop.  Instead, he let me show up hoping it would work out.

TREVOPEDIA,City Tours,4,en,This tour was really terrible. The driver got lost coming to the hotel and was on the phone speaking in Urdu the whole time I asked him to stop and talk to us about the places we are visiting. He would stop for few minutes and then keeps talking on the phone. Did not explain anything. I had to explain to my children the history of the places. He almost got in an accident and had to make a hard stop and my daughter hit her head. Before we got to the last stop he said we are taking a long time and that he has another trip and if I want to continue to negotiate with him and I understood it as he wanted me to give him more money. He picked us after 1 pm and dropped us at the Haram at 3:20 so it was 2:20 hours. He never explained anything and was on the phone all the time. I will not recommend this tour to anyone. You better off just hiring a taxi and have him take you to these places. Much cheaper.,"The ad is very misleading. For those travelling first time like I was I wanted to share this experience. I don’t normally do so but feeling is important to share this as it is very unfair.
I appreciate mistakes can be made but some things are not on.
When our correct driver arrived ( mistake rectified by the travel company - separate to this tour provider)  he was friendly enough but very little explanation. Only had an history provided for first site - which was about a minute long! No commentary for the rest and entry to half the places was not available. 
Further more after our first stop - Mount Uhud ( ps. Ziyarats are not in order of listed) which suggests a 40 minute stop. The driver actually informed us that he had been told that each stop was 10 mins!!! We confirmed with him the booking details and timings. We have spoken to the tour company who have not been helpful at all and stated the time includes the travel time to each of the sites. Very misleading; below average and at over £100 very expensive for such a poor tour. Other drivers have suggested they would not pay more than £70 for something like this.

I’m very disappointed and unfortunately would not recommend. We are in Medina our Beloved Prophets home, if you are wanting a Ziyarat I would highly recommend you look elsewhere.","Ok service.

We booked the visits to Dadan & Jabal Ikmah and the Old Town online. For the first one, as well as for Hegra, we parked in Winter park while for the second one we used the Old Town North Parking although we can also confirm that Old Town South Parking is closer to the starting point of the tour. The walking tour of the oasis (oasis trail) can be started from several points even if we have considered the best solution to use the car parking located on the other side of the road at the south end of the Old Town.  Among the things to do at sunset without a doubt Elephant Rock and the Harrat viewpoint are unmissable. Al Ula offers many other opportunities for visits and recreation and among them Rainbow Rock and Maraya cannot fail to be mentioned for its uniqueness.

Madain Saleh Tours,Multi-day Tours,4,en,"I visited Alula and took the Maidan Saleh tour. On the tour there was a man that harassed me, he kept taking pictures of me and saying very inappropriate jokes all while I was there with my babies husband and mother. I feel very disrespected and shocked. This man felt that it was ok for him to behave the way he did in front of my my and husband. 

When we complained to the tour guide (Ziad) who also claimed to be a manager, he told us to go to hell and that’s our problem. He made us go sit in the bus and end the tour. Security was called which I thought was going to solve the problem but that wasn’t the case. The man that harassed me, Ziad, and the security guy all worked together as a team, they were all protecting each other. When we realized they were a team, my husband confronted the man that harassed me and he said he was only taking snapchat pictures and it’s not a big deal, he even showed the picture like it’s nothing. The picture had my family in it. I asked for the US Embassy to be called, I asked for law enforcement to be present as we felt unsafe but none of those requests were answered. We were frightened and scared. They basically bullied us for complaining about the man that kept harassing me. 

We waited for them to respond for two hours sitting in the heat with our children. When we went back to Ziad and asked what was going on he told us go walk home if you don’t want to wait. So we paid for a tour in which we were harassed, bullied and trapped. We never got an apology and I don’t think it would help this case at this point. 

We came all the way from America (Denver Colorado) to visit this site and now we feel so disgusted, upset and disrespected. We will never come here again and report this as sexual harassment. We will not recommend this experience to anyone we know. How can a big organization like this have such horrible and unprofessional tour guides. We complained to several people, sent emails and heard nothing. We were not taken seriously at all.

Addas was reputed to be the only convert that the Prophet gained during his disappointing Taif visit.

Unfortunately the place was locked and lacked signs of care and maintenance. We were told this is deliberate as there were instances of irresponsible pilgrims coming to perform bid'ah and shirk practices at locations that have historical connections to the Prophet's visit to Taif.

Al-Dwaihra Mosque,Sacred & Religious Sites,5,ja,,,,,"日本から現地ガイド付きのツアーで訪れました。アル・ザウィハ・モスク(Al Dwaihra Mosque)は、「サウジアラビアの真珠」と呼ばれるディルイーヤ(Ad Diriyah)の、アル・ブジャイリ(Al Bujairi)地区にあります。リヤド中心部から北西約20kmに位置します。ワディ ハニファ(Wadi Hanifah)という渓谷に細い川が流れており、対岸はサウード王朝最初の首都でサルワ宮殿 (Salwa Palace)などがある世界遺産のアル・トライフ(Al Turaif)地区です。
川岸はナツメヤシが多く植えられ緑化されており、ピクニックができるような公園となっています。付近の日干し泥煉瓦造りの建物は美しく修復され、地面も石のタイルで覆われ、埃っぽさがまったくありません。モスクの周囲は細い路地となっています。

訪問した時は閑散としており、平日で誰一人いない状態でした。サウジアラビアでは観光地ごとにイベント時期が設定されており、ディルイーヤ シーズン(Diriyah Season)は11月から12月(前回は22 Nov 2019 - 21 Dec 2019)で、普段公開していない遺跡や施設を観ることが出来ますので、この付近を訪問するには最適な時期となります。Al UlaのWinter at Tantora Season 2 (19 Dec 2019 - 7 Mar 2020)の終わり近くに訪れましたので、ディルイーヤではイベント時期でなかったことと、ちょうどクラシックカーのイベント準備で周囲が封鎖されていたこともあります。
公園内やモスク入口にわかりやすい看板などが無いので、アル・ザウィハ・モスク (Al Dwaihra Mosque)には、アラビア語が分からない場合ガイドがいないと訪問は難しいと思います。係の方に中に入れて頂き、ガラス越しに室内を見学しました。

スンナ派の宗教学者ムハンマド・イブン・アブドゥルワッハーブ(Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab)は、1744年にディルイーヤのイブン・サウード(Ibn Saud)に迎え入れられ、教えを広めました。アル・ザウィハ・モスク (Al Dwaihra Mosque)がいつ建てられたかは不明ですが、かなり古いものです。サウジアラビアの10個に分類された歴史的モスクの建築様式ではナジド様式(Najdi Style)と、Abdullatif Al Fozan Awardの""Historical Mosques in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: Investigating Architectural Styles Typology""で解説されています。10個の内、今回の旅行で他にMimar MosqueとUmar Ibn Al Khattab MosqueとShafe’i Mosquesも訪れており、短期間で代表するモスクを目にできたことが嬉しく感じました。さらにAbdullatif Al Fozan Awardのサイトには、モスクの建築情報を網羅した「モスクペディア(Mosqpedia)」があり、「Dwaihra」で検索すると写真やDrawingsを参照でき、建築好きにとっては大変貴重なサイトです。

また、モスクの修復前の写真を探していたところ、The Royal Commission for Riyadh City(RCRC)のサイトの、Publications内に「Al-Bujairi…Heart of the Call」というアル・ブジャイリ(Al Bujairi)に関する情報が網羅されている134ページの出版物があり、エジプトの建築家Hassan Fathyが1960年代に撮影したモスクの写真が修復後の写真と共に載っています。他にもレンガや修復後の天井が確認できる写真、当時をイメージしたイラストなどもあります。モスク名は「Al Dhuwayhirah mosque」で記載されています。RCRCのサイトにはリヤドに関する資料が大変充実しており、サウジアラビアに関する出版物はまだ少ないので非常に参考になります。ちなみにアラビア語と英語のバージョンがあります。

モスクの修復前の写真を見るまでは、サウジアラビアの遺跡の修復方法は経年を感じさせない程きれいに直し過ぎると思っていましたが、建築方法が日干し泥煉瓦が基本のシンプルな工法なので、劣化した部分を直し通行可能な状態に修復すると、このように綺麗に直すしか方法が無いのだとよく理解できました。このような誤解を防ぐ為に、現地に修復前の写真を掲示して頂けると一目瞭然なのでわかりやすいと思います。",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1889404-d23146323-Reviews-Al_Dwaihra_Mosque-Diryah_Riyadh_Province.html,46.57528,24.73679,,"Al Imam Abdulaziz Ibn Mohammad Ibn Saud, Al Bujairi, Ad Diriyah, Diryah 13711 Saudi Arabia",,1

The House Of Syeda Fatima Bint Al-Husayn,Historic Sites,4,en,,,,"When visiting Makkah and Madinah, our purpose extends beyond performing Umrah and offering prayers at the Prophet Muhammad's (PBUH) mosque. We are drawn to these sacred cities by a desire to explore their rich religious, historical, and cultural significance, steeped in the spiritual aura of Islam. During our recent visit to Madinah, we had the privilege of visiting the house of Syeda Fatimah bint Husayn, a place deeply entrenched in history. She built this house and a well inside it when she moved from her grandmother Fatima's (RA) house. This move was necessitated when Fatima's house became part of the expanding Prophet's Mosque. Syeda Fatimah remained in Madinah while her father participated in the battle of Karbala, where he ultimately met his martyrdom in 110 AH. Fatima was also present in Karbala and was later taken as a captive to Kufa and then to Damascus, along with other members of Imam Hussain's family. Despite the hardships she endured, Fatima played a crucial role as a narrator of the tragic events of Karbala and its aftermath. It is said that Syeda Fatimah's resemblance to her grandmother, Fatima (RA), the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), was striking, adding a poignant layer to her story. Her life and experiences are a testament to the resilience and strength of faith that characterize the descendants of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).",,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298551-d27551401-Reviews-The_House_Of_Syeda_Fatima_Bint_Al_Husayn-Medina_Al_Madinah_Province.html,39.61417,24.46861,,"Al Usayfirin, Medina 42315 Saudi Arabia",,1

Angawi House,Architectural Buildings,4,en,,,,"I did a lot of research into Angawi House on my recent visit to Jeddah.
The house is privately owned and lived in by Dr Sami Angawi and his family.
Dr Angawi was born in Mecca and is an authority on Saudi Arabian architecture. The house is called Al Makkiyah and was 10 years in the making.
Dr Angawi built his house according to the wind. Capturing the wind from the north to the west, the house uses natural ventilation for half  of the year, throughout  different levels, limiting the need for air conditioning 
The house is constructed from many locally sourced materials. Dr Angawi’s wife Amira is an interior designer and whenever you see interior photographs of the house, you can see just how talented she is.
I discovered that the house is only available for visits and viewing at particular times and for group tours.
There was no such opportunity when I was in Jeddah, other than admiring the exterior of the house.
The research I did allowed me to discover that when there are opportunities for visits to the house the tickets cost around 200 riyals, which I believe includes tea being served to you.
It is difficult to find information on how you obtain tickets to see the house, if indeed this is still possible.

It's the second cinema to open in our city, which opened this August to a great fanfare after months of anticipation. The cinema is beautifully designed with large and welcoming entrance. There are plenty of counters at the snack bars so the lines are considerably shorter than the ones in VOX Cinema in Red Sea Mall (there is an inevitable comparison to me made here), but when it comes to the snacks themselves, I find them good but not great. In my opinion, the snacks at VOX are much better to be honest.    

The attitude of the employees is also indications of how extensive they were trained, as it make you feel they are trying to ensure the moviegoers have a pleasant experience every time. They are greeting their customers with welcoming smile upon their arrival and even when they leave. 

There are 15 screens in total: one landmark  Xperience screen with 400 seats and equipped with Dolby Atmos sound system, the first Screen X in the country, 3 luxury Suites screens, 1 Junior screen, and 9 standard screens. I have experienced the the Xperience, Screen X, and the standard screens, and my experience was very good most of the times. The seats are lavish and comfortable and there is enough space between rows for maximum comfort, the seat recline when you sit back which I personally don't like but many people love this feature. The sound system is great and the projection is clear and crisp. They also have the edge on VOX right now because customers don't have other options than online booking, as you can get your ticket from the box-office in the cinema itself (providing the screening you want is not already fully booked). That said, I find their website inferior to VOX's and there are many booking error it happen during the checking out process, plus as of now, they don't have a mobile app, which can be frustrating.

Overall, it is a great start and a welcome addition to the cinema scene in the Kingdom, but there is a room for improvement for sure, and I hope they keep working on that.","very good popcorn and movie but people are talking  a lot but gotta say very good 5 stars

365 Adventures Saudi Arabia,Parasailing & Paragliding,3,en,,,"I loved being out in the water with all my friends, and nothing could have ruined that but honestly the staff during our trip nearly did. I’m a fairly experienced kayaker in seas, lakes, rivers and rapids and this is the first time I have been discriminated against because of my size. (I would say I’m small-mid fat, US size 16-18) The member of staff told me and my whole group that I should use a double kayak “because of my weight” but didn’t back this up with an explanation. Maybe the kayaks here are cheaper and less sea worthy than others I’ve used previously. I did it anyway to save embarrassment and time because the process of getting us on the water was very slow. As it happened, the girl who shared with me was much smaller and the weight distribution was completely wrong due to this being a double kayak. I felt unsafe the whole time but luckily, as mentioned I am experienced and a very strong swimmer.  Then we had a great time all kayaking together and swimming together, but at the end another member of staff suggested we set up a photo for breast cancer awareness and told us to “form the shape of a ribbon with our kayaks”. She had no idea how to direct this and expected us to just know how to make the shape she envisioned with no help or leadership. We tried for about 10 minutes but all ended up very frustrated and cranky because we couldn’t get this task right. Then we had an equally slow process of getting out of our kayaks as we had getting in them. 

So to sum up- you will have fun with your friends, but prepared to be fat shamed if you dare to be out in public in a swimsuit and you are over a size 16.",,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293995-d27742881-Reviews-365_Adventures_Saudi_Arabia-Riyadh_Riyadh_Province.html,,,+966 55 594 9365,"Qirawaan Dist.

Snow City,Game & Entertainment Centers,3.5,en,,"We went to snow city today with my 2 children and husband. We were disappointed to find out the 2 year old was not able to join because there were no suits his size. My husband and I decided he would go in with our 6yr old while I wandered about the mall for the 2 hrs. After wandering around the mall for some time I decided to head back up to snow city and get my 2 yr old a snack and we would watch the rest of our family through the window while he ate. We saw other families were sitting up at tables and chairs directly in front of the large window and so we also sat here assuming it was for snow city and people that may be waiting on family. As the cafe next to it was closed and there was no signage, I and the other 4 people assumed this would be fine. 15 mins later my 2yr old is enjoying his lunch and the other people had left their tables. It was at this point I was aggressively approached by a man that worked at the cafe Roti Mum (embroidered tshirt) located within the snow city complex. Never have I been approached in such a disgusting vile manner. He was extremely aggressive in yelling at me that the table I was sitting at was only for patrons of Roti Mum Café. Despite the disgusting way he addressed me, I clarified that the seats were not for snow city  to which his was response was "" where are you from? Do you speak English? Do you understand? "" you leave"" you put this in ?#&#^"" I am from Australia and did not appreciate the patronising condescension. Once I pointed out that my husband was in snow city (he had seen the commotion and had walked over to the window) he was very quick to back off. Absolutely disgusting, this man was also an expat (Indian at a guess) and to be so aggressive in front of a toddler. Being Australian, we of course put rubbish in the bin, my son had not finished eating and there were no signs to indicate the tables were allocated to Roti Mum Café (ironically we had intended to try this cafe when it opened. Won't be doing that.) Mosin or Moishin is what he told me his name was. This unfortunately ruined what started off as an enjoyable outing to snow city.","Over all good different experience, pricy with a time limit  they provide u with ski clothes gloves helmet and shoes for kids make sure u take the right helmet  , reception  is so friendly  i bought my ticket a head , they have not bad offers, changing arena is small the bathrooms smelly and dirty , in the snow land unfortunately their are no signs that says where the game starts and u might go on line and when u reach there they ask u to get a board from down, no direction signs or lightning men are more friendly than the ladies in the arena , unorganized , the ice is ruff for playing they have a laser show fun for 5 and below , over all different nice experience but watch out for safety after 2 hours it gets very cold u cant feel ur nose nor ur hands 2 hours is more than enough for all games",Children loved it.

Jeddah Desert Safari,Parasailing & Paragliding,3,en,"ZERO STARS! We just came back from the tour, very disappointed. The “knowledgeable tour guide” did not speak any English and did not speak at all the whole 1.5 hour drive. We only did 2 activities if you can call them that. There was no camel riding, no Arabian photo shoot with costumes,the camel farm was just some camels in the middle of the desert with no explanation or guidance. No Arabian desert tent with coffee and dates, no sand surfing.
We were driven up and down the sand dunes in the jeep and we got to ride the 4x4. Driver was also looking for gas the whole way there, exiting the highway multiple times, which added to the time we spend getting to our destination.
We were given 4 very small miniature bottles of water and juice, we definitely needed more hydration. I contacted the operator after, and his response was: The camel died, no surfboarding because the last person was “broken” so they canceled that activity, and that all these things were not advertised.

She spoke excellent English (with American slang) that she learned “from movies”.

The afternoon lighting was best for seeing the tombs, but difficult to photograph from such a distance.  There was a clear path from the visitor center and well-constructed steps to reach the Lion’s Tomb, but the authorities must think that tourists would be irresponsible or incapable of walking uphill for 5 minutes.  The guide provided binoculars to see the tombs better, but it wasn’t so impressive from so far away, after already seeing the Nabatean tombs at Hegra the day before.

 Visitors can also walk through a transparent tunnel that runs through the aquarium offering a close-up view of the underwater world.

Munir Daya","I was really impressed with Jeddah’s King Abdulaziz International Airport. It is new and well designed and its architecture really impressive.
The airport facilities are really good both as a traveller arriving or as a traveller departing.
When you arrive it is well signed and if using it, the visa on arrival service is very user friendly and swiftly processed.
There were a lot of pilgrims visiting Mecca for Umrah when I first arrived. The airport is well set up for dealing with large amounts of people and opened up two extra immigration lanes for those entering Saudi Arabia and not visiting Mecca.
I was really impressed at just how quickly, despite the amount of travellers, I got through immigration.
Once you have retrieved baggage you exit into a very large area which has a huge aquarium in its centre. There are plenty of cafes and shops and lots of people willing to help you.
The only difficulty I experienced was trying to get into the airports free wifi. This was because the telephone numbers that could be registered had to be from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan or Iran. I really struggled trying to register for the free wifi with my English phone.
It wasn’t a problem for long as so many people just want to welcome you to KSA and allow you to link into their wifi. There was no issues with this at all and it made liaising with my taxi driver a lot easier.
Just a point to note, vehicles aren’t allowed to collect passengers outside arrivals due to the Police preventing this. This is because of the amount of pilgrims and this area being very congested. Taxis and other vehicles collect their passengers from outside the departures area.
When departing through the airport the processes are just as slick and the facilities just as good. The airport has a lot of different shops, cafes and restaurants and also a big duty free. Everywhere is immaculately clean.

There’s absolute no concern regarding pilgrims in this holy city. Other pilgrims are absolutely fine. But in this instance the driver failed to show up twice to collect me from the hotel. After the first time they admitted their mistake and we rescheduled then the tour this time not only the driver failed to turn up the so called management contact I had just stopped answering my messages. And this has only happened here in Mecca. The other cities in Saudi have been great in Riyadh and not to mention Medina the residents have been wonderful real suadis and real Muslims whom I interacted with. The Hadith of the prophet regarding spending too much time in this place is just another proof of the beautiful religion of ours. Remember it is our deeds that get us into the place we all want to be not our lineage. Another Hadith.

""The Globe"" 

• This is the restaurant/cafe operated by Mandarin Oriental.
• I have not visited the restaurant but it is trusted to be one of the best as it is ran by Mandarin Oriental.

""The Experience""

• This is where you can go for sightseeing and see the beautiful Riyadh. 
• There is entrance fee (best to call for the most updated rate)
• The staff will press the designated floor you'll be which is the Gallery. 
• You can find the history of Al Faisaliah design but you will already have a good indoor view of Riyadh.
• There's another lift that takes you up to either Experience, Globe, Sky Mall.
• Take the elevator to go up the Experience and that is where you can have the best 360 degree outdoor view of Riyadh.

The updated timings from the time we visited for ""Experience"" is from 13:00 - 23:00 DAILY. You must call them first if you choose to visit on holiday or RAMADAN as the timing may change. 

You can buy the ticket inside Al Faisaliah Tower. I have not seen any online tickets available to go up, you have to go directly and get the tickets from there.

Timings (as of April 2024)

Asir Lounge
Daily: 16:00 - 01:00

The Globe Dinner
Daily: 19:00 - 23:00
Fridays & Saturdays: 20:00 - 23:30

High Tea (225 SAR)
Fridays and Saturdays: 15:00 - 18:00

Parking Space:

• If you are coming from the mall, you can park it at the basement or valet it (with valet fee)
• If you are coming from Mandarin Hotel, the hotel is adjacent to the tower but I would assume it will have a charge if you are not a guest from the hotel (verify and plan ahead to call the hotel if you choose to park from there)
• You can also park directly at Al Faisaliah Tower with a valet fee.

This complex comprises seven mosques intricately linked to the Prophet's life and the Battle of Khandaq (the Trench), which was a defensive trench dug by Muslims to protect Medina from the advancing armies of Quraysh and their allies in 5 A.H. The defenders of Medina were stationed in these mosques, each named after the individual stationed there, except for Al-Fath Mosque. Proceeding from north to south, the mosques are Al-Fath Mosque, Salman Al-Farsi Mosque, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq Mosque, Umar bin Khattab Mosque, Ali bin Abi Talib Mosque, Fatimah Az-Zahra Mosque, Saad ibn Mo’az Mosque, and Qiblatain Mosque. Although the Qiblatain Mosque is one kilometer away from the others, it is included because pilgrims visiting the first six mosques typically also visit the Qiblatain Mosque. The largest mosque, Al-Fath, derives its name from the revelation of the Quran's Al-Fath Surah at that location, symbolizing the triumph of Muslims in the battle.","The trips was to Mekah & Medina.

It’s an impressive sight and worth seeing. 

However! Important notes:

1. Whilst it is technically possible to climb down into the crater, you are not actually allowed to do so and security to patrol the area. This is because people have struggled to get back out in the past.

2. There is no obvious campsite in the volcano rim and it’s very difficult to peg tents into the hard ground. However around 300m to the north of the crater there are lava flows with sandy beds in between which provide cover and better camping

3. The terrain is hard, stony and ridged. Take a spare tyre and go in a vehicle that can handle rugged off-roading 

4. By day we found it to be sunny and pleasant. At night the temperature dropped and there was a howling wind which others had reported so it wasn’t a one-off! See point 2 above. But take a sturdy and/or low tent

5.

When I saw it the Saudi Arabia flag was flying from it, apparently this is not always the case. It always feels patriotic to me to see a country proudly flying their flag.
A few facts and figures:
It stands at 561ft and took 500 tons of steel to make. The Saudi Arabia flag flying from it measures 49.5m x 33m and weighs 570kg
It used to be the tallest flagpole in the world until 2021 when the flagpole in Cairo became the tallest.
The flag was first hoisted on September 23rd 2014, this date being the National Day of Arabia.","Флагшток Джидды находится на площади короля Абдаллы, имеет высоту 171 метр, считался самым высоким флагштоком в мире до 26 декабря 2021 года, пока Каирский флагшток его не обогнал.

At-Turaif,مواقع تاريخية,4,en,"I got Al Turaif access only ticket for 10am to 4:59pm entry for today. When I arrived someone named Mohamed was very nice and showed me where to enter Al Turaif. I proceeded to the entrance, and one of the guards told me it would open in 1.5 hours. It was around 1:15pm at the time. He also said 2pm it would open, so he basically wasn't even sure himself. I asked why , but he could not explain in his limited English. I had a drink and just moved aside to wait. Then another guard came to me and very rudely told me I could not stand there. There were lots of people walking around in that area, so I asked why I couldn't wait. He didn't know any English at all but that wasn't an excuse for his rudeness because he then used Google translate, which told me ""you have to move"". If he was going to use Google translate, he could've told me what was going on and given me a reason and just been more polite. But no, he was just plain rude. So I came out to the front entrance looking for the nice guy Mohamed. He apologized and told me something to the effect that he also just found out it was closed until 2pm, because there was some kind of VIP entourage touring the place or something? That's just crazy that the staff working there aren't even told what's going on. I thought this was just a one-off thing, but I just read a review from Sam S who seemed to have had he same experience last month. So these closure times are obviously pretty regular, but there are no notices anywhere and the staff claim to have no knowledge of all this. Ive got a tight schedule, and I was closer to Masmak Fort, but decided to take an Uber to Diriyah instead. If I'd known I'd be wasting time here, I could've seen Masmak and area before coming here. In the end, I couldn't even go because they said it was closed. That's SAR 110+ wasted money but what do they care. DO NOT COME HERE!!!!!!!!!","I feel like this is still being developed and has some potential but there is something missing as an experience right now. We went during the day as the website would not accept our credit cards (tried four different Canadian ones) and so we could not buy the night time ticket. During the day, you do need a ticket but it is free. There is no way to buy the ticket at the site - you must get it online. It was super quiet with a few other visitors and a lot of staff showing the way around the site. There was a few small ""museums"" with great air conditioning, but otherwise it was very empty with a lot of closed and locked doors. There were other tourists wandering around like us looking kind of bored and lost. The ruins are being restored but with nothing inside them. 

I would have loved to see some examples of furnished rooms, artifacts, and clothing. I had seem many beautiful painted doors in some antique shops and hoped to see those here but, instead, all the doors are new and painted exactly the same. We wandered through the restaurant area (Bujairi Terrace) but nothing was open except two restaurants (we ate at Brunch and Cake - which was excellent). We could not get reservations for the dinner as you need to buy a ticket for the area and the credit cards were a problem. I also understand that Saudis like to go out at night, but as a tourist, it makes it hard to find things to do all day. Also, some shops with local products would be nice here and add to the experience.

There are no shops, no restaurants, food trucks, or fuel stations, so you have to bring everything with you. But better let somebody know where you are, as nobody there to help you if you get unconscious or something else does happen.

Dadan & Jabal Ikmah,مواقع تاريخية,4,en,"So, of course, the roads would be spectacular if you could get closer than maybe a mile away from them. They’ve built a path that walks to them, but you’re not allowed on the path so you have to look through a telescope to see the lines that are carved into the side of the rock. Basically if you’ve come here you’ve come thousands and thousands of miles and all you’re allowed to do is basically look through a telescope when there’s a very clearly made path that’s quite flat which is about a 15 minute walk which are not allowed to go on, but which is clearly in front of you. I found this extremely upsetting and such a waste of thousands of dollars to travel here. I would skip this place and go somewhere else until they have opened up the path.","AlUla tourism has a problem with how they deal with tourists. They have decided that either you pay for a guided bus tour which gives you extremely limited time to see the sights, or you pay too much money to be shepherded around in a ""vintage Land Rover"" (as if anyone cares about what kind of car drives you to a heritage site) for the same amount of time, but without the other people. 
The experience of Dadan, in all honesty, was a joke. You cannot get close enough to see the only thing of interest at this site. So if you didn't bring your own binoculars, you can share the four provided on site with everyone else. The road is just behind you, you have exactly the same experience from the road. Then, after spending a full three minutes being told about the lions, you are hurried over to play in a sandbox. Twenty minutes. Grown adults who have travelled across the world to see the history of this place were given more time to pretend to dig up pottery than to learn about the site. 
Then you're driven three feet over to see the archaeological site where you're shown photos of the same archaeological site. 

Jabal Ikmah was better, the engravings and the site itself are astonishing. It was a real pleasure to discover this place and the thousands of years of history it represents. However, once again, be ready to be herded off again way too soon. 
After this visit you're given chisels and a rock and can carve some shapes if you're interested. It was actually quite fun at the end of the visit, however the fact that they factor in these kinds of activities that no one asked for into the time and price is frustrating and felt rather infantilising.",,,"Dadan und Igmal haben wir in Kombination besucht.

Many locals warned there will be long queues starting from entrance to the car park. Therefore it'd good to arrive early.
I left hotel Orchid Suites 4 (btw. new and very nice with reasonable price and helpful staff), located 3 km from the stadium, 3 hrs before the kick-off. Right outside of the hotel, a saudi man with his son, stopped their car and asked if I'm going to stadium and told to step in! Where else this could happen? So we were at the parking area very early. Without any queues at security check or the gates it took roughly 15 minutes to reach my seat located just behind Juventus bench.

There was VIP-sector behind the team benches. There were fences on both side of VIP-area, so it was not possible to go around the stadium at lower level.
The facilities at the stadium were well organized, not much queueing for food, toilet, etc., not even during and after the match.

The only negative is not because of the stadium but the people. How can it be so difficult to take Your own seat, marked at Your ticket. The staff continuously ordered people to move to their correct seats(even to the other block), but they didn't until the right owner of that seat arrived. It took half an hour after match start and still this stupid show with seat changing continued.
Obviously, it was not allowed to sit at the aisles but people didn't move away even ordered to do so. Just wondering what'll happen in case of some emergency?

Leaving the stadium was easy as well, partly because I stayed there until the end of winner's party.",https://ar.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295419-d15814883-Reviews-King_Abdullah_Sports_City-Jeddah_Makkah_Province.html,43.94769,26.37829,,"طريق الأمير طلال بن منصور بن عبدالعزيز, جدة المملكة العربية السعودية",http://www.kasc.com,5

The road north of Khayber is desolate - largely lava fields with some sand. The modern town of Khayber generally is clean and, although large, a restaurant was not to be seen. Old Khayber is slightly to the northwest of new Khayber and and an internet map engine easily brought us to the site.  Old Khayber is closed in Saudi Arabia's efforts to clean and update the location for future tourism. (The Country is being very successful in this effort.) However, there are a number of side roads and vista's around Old Khayber which are not restricted and which provide an opportunity to view and drive through part of the ancient ruins (the fort is not approachable). There are acres and acres of ruins almost as far as the eye can see and, if you choose, you can walk among those not closed. The ruins largely are of black stone (basalt) and the more ""modern"" of mud.  

For those who are jaded from many tours of ancient civilizations, the site perhaps may not be impressive (there is no Roman Amphitheatre here).

Umrah Limo,سيارات أجرة وحافلات نقل,4.5,en,"This is the most disgusting car company I have had to deal with in my life!

Well in advance (actually 5 months back) I booked and fully paid a round-trip starting on the 30th March 2024 from Jeddah Int'l Airport to Mecca Hotel, on 11th April from Mecca Hotel to Madinah Hotel and finally on 13th April from Madinah Hotel to Jeddah Int'l Airport, all paid for a GMC 2024 vehicle (superior price compared to other vehicles!).

A couple of days before 30th March, Mr Saeed (Manager) and his lady colleague, Ms Sobha, sent me a WhatsApp msg saying that the GMC 2024 got a sudden breakdown (!) and that they could offer me a Hiace or a Staria vehicle. I objected but they told me that I could cancel and get a refund if I wished (2 days before my journey starts!). I finally accepted knowing that I wouldn't have time to arrange for another transport. Finally, the Hiace picked me and my family up at the airport. The van was very dirty and bad-smelling. Moreover, the driver was eternally on his mobile phone (I don't know if this is allowed in Saudi Arabia?!)

I finally learned from Mr Akeel (their Operations Manager) and another driver (Mr Aftab) that the GMC (new) never got a breakdown, it was used for another trip on that day (surely one that brought much more profit to the company!)

For my trip from Mecca Hotel to Madinah Hotel, this was another (more or less the same) story. Initially, the GMC was not available and they proposed an old Chevrolet. After fierce complaint, finally the GMC was made available again to me! The journey was ok but that driver was similar to the other one. He even had one leg crossed on his seat and let go the vehicle at its own pace (around 80kph), even if the speed limit was either 120 or 140kph. He was more concentrated on his phone calls! Even if I complained to him once, he stopped for 5 mins but could not bear to hold anymore and he retarted again!

For my final trip from Madinah Hotel to Jeddah Int'l Airport, having warned Mr Saeed and Mr Akeel about the driver, I made a nice trip, even reaching the destination 40 minutes in advance, the driver having driven the car normally and not speaking eternally on the phone!

So, if after reading my comments, you still want to take the service of UmrahLimo (they are partnered with Labaik Tours), I wish you good luck!",,,,I booked sedan car for my solo trip to Saudi arabia for umrah.I got best service.They guide me bout everything.

Riyadh Golf Club,ملاعب جولف,4.5,en,,,"The Riyadh Golf Club is a desert experience LIV golfers might enjoy. This layout , one of 3 courses in Riyadh, is moderately easy if you can avoid the giant bunkers around every green. Botched drives land in the desert hardscape then bounce onto lush green fairways. It's sort of like Scottish Highland Golf but in the desert. Greens are generally even but slow. There is a small lake - yes a lake - in the desert. During our mid-day round there were many maintenance workers on the course with high end golf course machinery. Unfortunately, beyond the fairway fences are ugly wastelands and dump sites. 
The Club House has limited food and of course no alcohol or beer. It caters to parties and events. None of the staff we met in the pro shop or the Club House plays golf. 
There is an excellent driving range and practice area. 
Saudi Arabia is trying to make a major foray into the golf business with its investment in the professional LIV golf tour. Saudi leadership says it wants to introduce its citizens to golf. The day we played, the course was not crowded. The players were mostly foreign businessmen and their wives. Many of the caddies and maintenance workers were migrants from South East Asia. 
After our round, we had a coke on the patio watching several groups of Saudi women in full niqab come to the patio, order a coke, look at the golf activity, then leave. One hopes there is a future for golf in the Kingdom. 
",,"RGC is undergoing some work to improve facilities, soon to be relocating the pro shop upstairs. 

The golf club is north of Riyadh and is well worth a visit. The course is well maintained and was in great condition when I played. The buggies all have GPS.

Just go to Mount Harrat viewpoint to see the extent of Al Ula oasis. The presence of palm trees makes this place relatively cool and pleasant to walk around. For this reason, walking trails (to which different names have been given) have been created, and which network run through a large part of the oasis. Well indicated by the presence of signs, these trails can be accessed from several points in Al Ula, from the Old Town to Dadan. We parked the car at the oasis car park which can be reached by leaving the route 375 in front of the Old Town, turning right (if you go north) into the only unpaved road that enters the oasis (car parking GPS: 26.627044, 37.916876). Alternatively, you can park at Old Town Nord Parking or, if you find space, at Dadan. Walking along these paths you can see the old houses (largely destroyed by time) where the ancient inhabitants of the Old Town came to live in the hot summer, while some cultivation activity is still present. Even if each trail is mostly under palm trees, a cap and sunscreen are highly recommended in addition to a bottle of water. We only walked part of the trails in the afternoon and we found this activity pleasant and interesting.","Right through the valley in Al Ula it is green with date palms and various other crops.

Ten years later, it is very clear it is deteriorating at a fast pace. It's a complete shame on the municipality for not taking care of their heritage and connection to their own history.","The posters of 'Taif Season' feature the Shubra Palace. It is the premier atraction in Taif but that isn't enough to have it opened on a weekend. So much for encouraging tourism.

The palace was built in 1905 on the orders of Sharif Ali Pasha. The palace is the most stunning vestige of old Taif, with latticework windows and balconies, and interior marble from Carrara as we saw on some websites and later from the windows since the palace was closed when we were there. 

 King Abdulaziz (The establisher of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) used to stay here, and the palace was later the residence of King Faisal during his Summer holidays. Now it has been turned to a museum. 

We were there hoping that we would get the chance to discover this wonderful palace but unfortunately, there was no sign about opening hours / time. There was a big sign that shows the city of Taif is going to host a festival on Summer and later we were informed that the palace opens only on Summer. 

It’s a pity and shame that the municipality of Taif is not taking care of and paying more attention to this wonderful historical palace yet and I hope they do, one day.",,https://ar.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298553-d8656078-Reviews-Shubra_Palace-Taif_Makkah_Province.html,40.414757,21.28592,,"‪7881 Shubra‬, الطائف المملكة العربية السعودية",,29

It is an ideal spot for group or family activities, as well as relaxation. I recommend bringing any necessary items such as chairs, tables, and towels. The shallow water allows you to wade about 50 meters from shore while still touching the ground, but beware of sudden drops beyond that point. During the Eid-ul-Fitr holidays, we spent our 2nd day at this beach, which was bustling with locals and tourists. It is a great spot for picnics, swimming, and various other beach activities for a delightful time, including sunbathing, swimming, boat trips, barbeque, water sports, horse riding, quad biking on dunes, and car drift driving. Although it is situated outside the city, this picturesque crescent-shaped beach boasts several public and private beaches along its miles-long stretch of coastal road. There are five different public beach areas along the shoreline namely Marjan, Sadaf, Al Turki, Mahar, and one more.","Whether you’re a kitesurfing beginner or advance rider, we can assist in soaring right into the sport with ease at GKP, especially since kitesurfing is the fastest growing water sport in the word!

If you’re looking for any sort of guidance or assistance, the community offers IKO lessons and equipment through its kitesurfing community of Gulf Kitesurfing Paradise.

One of the major highlights of the beach is its safety. Imagine yourself strolling along the pristine white sand, with turquoise waters glistening in the sunlight that welcomes only kite-surfers! And, if you’re really lucky, a dolphin might tail you while you’re trying out waterstart in kitesurfing.

The team offers a safe, serene and idyllic atmosphere, away from the hustle and bustle of Half Moon Beach. Whether you want to  build sandcastles or simply relax with a good book, the whole place offers the perfect setting for a blissful beach experience.

As I said, this is not Dubai but I guess they will get there at some point.",,"Within the new Terminal One at Jeddah International Airport you will enjoy a very professionally run Business Class Lounge called: Al Fursan Business Class Lounge. 
This lounge is easy to find and is quite large, not like in the old South Terminal at Jeddah International Airport. 
This is a true International Business Class Airport Lounge with all of the amenities that any other International Airport would have, plus a few more. 
I like the idea of a “Live Cooking Station” and each time there I have really enjoyed the food.
Plus there are many break-out areas where you can enjoy peace-and-quiet. 
Finally, one new item I hadn’t seen before in any International Airport Business Class Lounge is a “Robotic Beverage Server”, which goes around one of the large break-out areas. Very, very unique!
All-in-all, trust me as I know that you will really enjoy the Al Fursan Business Class Lounge located in the new Terminal One of Jeddah International Airport. 
","What an absolute delight it was being able to experience the Al Fursan lounge at Jeddah’s new King Abdulaziz International Airport.
The facilities provided are really fantastic. 
The design of the lounge is excellent. There are lots of different areas and places to sit and relax. There are also sleeping booths and great washrooms and showering facilities.
There are plenty of places for charging your phone / computer etc and there are even large iPads available for your use. There are also a lot of different newspapers and magazines to read.
It’s the food and drink stations that really stand out though. Many of them are cooking stations meaning that the food is chosen by you and freshly prepared by them, while you wait. 
There are pizza stations, omelette stations, sandwich stations to name but a few.
There are also places to help yourself to a drink or use the barrister station. I particularly loved this one. The choice of drinks on offer were great. My barrister made a delicious latte. I also ordered a raspberry mojito from here and it was really tasty (non alcoholic of course) 
There’s also a great dessert station where all manner of fancy and really delicious sweet treats are on offer, including big pieces of chocolate. 
Sometimes you find yourself in a place where you don’t feel like you’re killing time, it’s more a case of wishing you could make time go a little slower just to enjoy your surroundings for longer.",https://ar.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295419-d25294142-Reviews-Al_Fursan_Business_Class_Lounge-Jeddah_Makkah_Province.html,39.142944,21.689692,,"‪King Abdulaziz International Airport‬ Second Floor, جدة المملكة العربية السعودية",,6

1.	Hejaz Railway Station: Opened in 1908 and closed in 1920, the Ottoman Empire built this railway and ran from Damascus to Medina. It fell into disrepair after the Arab Revolt of 1917.
2.	Battle of Badr Memorial: This memorial lists the names of the companions of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) who were martyred in the first battle for Islam.
3.	Masjid al-Fas’ah: The demolished remains at the foot of Mount Uhud mark where the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) offered Dhuhr prayer during the Battle of Uhud.
4.	Masjid al-Fatah: This mosque marks the site where the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) supplicated during the Battle of Khandaq and received glad tidings of victory from Allah.
5.	Masjid al-Ghamama: Located 300 meters southwest of Masjid-e-Nabawi, this mosque was built where the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) performed Eid salah in his later years.
6.	Masjid Jumah: This mosque marks the spot where Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) led the first-ever Jummah prayer with about 100 companions.
7.	Masjid al-Ra’yah: Situated on Mount Dhubab, this mosque marks the spot where the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) pitched his tent while digging the trench for the Battle of Khandaq.
8.	Masjid al-Shaikhain: This mosque marks the spot where the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) prayed on the eve of the Battle of Uhud and prepared for the battle.
9.	Mount Uhud: Located north of Medina, this mountain was the site of the second battle between the Muslim community of Medina and the Quraysh tribe from Makkah.
10.	Qiblah Change Pillar: This pillar, located near Bab-e-Jibraeel, marks the spot where the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) led prayer in Medina when the Qiblah was towards Masjid al-Aqsa, opposite Makkah.",https://ar.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298551-d26770176-Reviews-Historical_Places_of_Medina-Medina_Al_Madinah_Province.html,39.61417,24.46861,,"‪Haram‬, المدينة المنورة المملكة العربية السعودية",,1

Things to note: it is a climb and there are places where you are scrambling up high and even need to descend on your bum as it is very steep, so you need to be ok with that.  We were picked up at 4.30pm because of the heat, if we did it again we would ask to be picked up an hour earlier and take the first half hour of the climb in stronger heat as it’s a quick climb to the top otherwise and it’s a push, you also come down in the dark with a headlamp so again, you just need to be ok with that. And if you are ok with all that, then do it, it’s a truly incredible experience!",The green side of Saudi was surprisingly astonishing also hiking under Abha's rain was a life time experience for me. I felt safe and got to know alot about one of the oldest trading routes between yemen and saudi. Thanks to Osama a professional tour guide who loves his job and does hus best to enjoy your time.,https://ar.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298542-d24163826-Reviews-Abha_Trips-Abha_Asir_Province.html,,,,أبها المملكة العربية السعودية,http://Abhatrips.com,81

We moved in the evening when the temperature is lower and the deserted village begins to populate with people. This village is very safe. We went to the old part where there are some historic buildings with the typical windows and very short balconies and to the market. Through the city streets the number of stray cats you meet is impressive: thin and proud felines that move with ease and without fear. A nice seaside village even if the most interesting part is represented by the boat tours.","All you need to know about Umluj. 😍

Our stay-🏚
We stayed in yanbu which is 2hours away drive from Umluj.
We booked @novotel_yanbu through booking.com for three nights.

Umluj Boat ride-🛥
We booked our ride from @umluj_serves. There are different rates  for different boats and yachts. You can choose your timings, we went from 9am to 1pm.
We were a group of 10 people and opted for this boat in frame and it costed us total sr1000 + sr130 (fruit basket) for 4 hours. 

Keep exploring for more boats as you can get cheaper ones too, we got to know about the cheaper ones after we had booked and did the advance payment. So keep contacting different boat guides. 

Activities-🚤
•If you're lucky then you can get to see dolphins, turtles and fish. Unfortunately we couldn't see dolphins or turtles.🐬🐢🐠
Tip- carry khubs or roti so that seagulls can come closer to you. 

• Our boat anchored  into the middle of the sea where there was shallow water and we stayed there for around 2 hours. It was definitely the best experience from the whole boat ride. Swimming, floating and relaxing and clicking pictures. All you could see was crystal clear water and beautiful shades of blue around till far. 
😍
• Fishing- none of us were interested in it so we didn't do fishing. 🐠

Definitely a mesmerising experience for sea lovers.❤❤❤",https://ar.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g17792905-d21287972-Reviews-Umluj_Tours-Umluj_Tabuk_Province.html,,,+966 55 801 8938,"‪Olya St‬, املج 33511 المملكة العربية السعودية",https://saudiarabiatours.net/umluj-tours/,4

Dive Point Jeddah,غوص بالمعدات وغوص حر,4.5,en,"Found this Dive Center to be highly unresponsive to the inquires sent to the Business WhatsApp Account on multiple occasions, as well as exploiting tourist’s lack of knowledge in the cost of diving by charging twice what was quoted from their competitors. 

Take my advice, if you want to scuba dive or learn how, go to someone who cares more than just about the profit they will earn off you. 

Was quoted 750 Saudi Riyal (aka. $200) for 2 shore dives off the resort beach. As a price comparison, this would have been the most expensive dives I would have done, only being surpassed by The Great Blue Hole in Belize (UNESCO World Heritage site) @$250 !

Al-Haddad Scuba,غوص بالمعدات وغوص حر,4,en,"Our family’s experience with Al-HADDAD Scuba and Platinumlist was nothing short of a nightmare. We had booked a day trip a Bayada  Island for 2 adults and 1 5 years old child, only to be met with with a series of misssteps and disappointments. From the get-go, the communication was chaotic.the provided time for the excursion was incorrevate,leaving us stranded on April 11st without a way to partecipate in the activity we had paid 1125 Ryals, 300 euro. Furthermore we discovered later that Bayadha Island was merely a  dream, as the location was great coral reef near Jeddah on a  boat with 50 divers. We spent enterly the day on a crowded barge with no respit from the blistering 36 degree heat. Our child was unable to swim in the diving centric waters, had nothing to do throughout all day. Bayadha Island remained a distant mirage, never once sighted during the excursion. Our complaints were met with dismissiveness and unprofessionalism, culminating in our legitimate grievances being ignored and promptly deleted after notification. Platinumlist’s lack of accountability and blatant disregard for customer satisfaction is deeply concerning. Future travelers beware! DO NOT TRUST AL HADDAD SCUBA. They will take your money and deliver only disappointment in return.","Boat trip was just a huge mess. Took almost 3 hours until the boat finally left the marina. It was overcrowded with about 50 snorklers and divers. Several tanks were not secured and they did not even bring enough for the number of divers. I was not asked for my certification or my diving experience, groups were put together randomly. The reef was quite disappointing and not worth the long boat ride. In more than 500 dives I have also never seen the guide using a scooter under water as he moves forward much faster than the group and the noise is scaring marine life away. The only highlight were some big curious silky sharks but I would not recommend snorkling there or let inexperienced divers go without any instructions on how to behave with these potentially dangerous sharks, especially being far away from shore. I would highly recommend more safety measures. The only positive point was that the crew, although apparently inexperienced and overstrained, was very friendly, tried to solve the problems and make the best out of the mess.",,"The people from Al-Haddad were super friendly, great English and very helpful with everything surrounding my snorkeling trip. Gear was included and they also have a shop if you feel like getting your own stuff. The coral reefs we visited were really pretty, with lots of fish. I am deducting one star due to throwing the anchor right into the corals, I understand that the depth of the water makes anchoring very difficult but there has to be a better way than this :) .  Otherwise I can only recommend them! ","We went for the snorkeling tour with Al Haddad and all was booked through e mail and phone it was easy. We had a hotel pick up that was also organized professionally. We cruised for 30 minutes to come to the site and the boat is comfortable and safe.

My Saudi Tours,جولات لعدة أيام,4.5,en,,,"After a 6 am pickup from our hotel, this was a very long day, getting back after 8pm. So we saw a lot (although not everything on the advertised itinerary). Our driver was friendly and helpful, if not super-chatty, expert or with perfect English. We really appreciated the insight he was able to give us into Saudi life though. It was great to get up into the mountains, where the air is drier and in the evening much cooler. There are a number of areas in which Saudi tourism has still to optimise: the litter, the feeding of wild animals against the rules, the realisation that things which may appeal to Saudis might not have the same novelty to Europeans, and finally the cost. (Why does this very expensive trip cost twice as much for a couple as for one person, when the extra cost incurred by the company is negligible?) We did enjoy the trip as it enabled us to see things we could not have seen otherwise. We had a good Saudi meal at lunch time, and an excellent falafel at the end of the day.

Desert Paths,جولات لعدة أيام,5,en,,,,,"Having read about the purported real Mount Sinai being in Saudi Arabia with seemingly convincing evidence,

I did some research on some companies. There are many companies out there but in the end, I went with Desert Paths for the Land of Midian tour (3 days 2 nights). Pricing was extremely reasonable compared to others. 

Communication was with Gabriel who is the owner. There were some issues in the beginning due to bank details being incorrect but after that, everything went smoothly.

The tour itself was well run and you can tell the trip had been done many, multiple times over the years. Everything went so smoothly like melted butter. Each and every location we visited, a passage from the Exodus (Bible) was read outloud to bring real meaning. We were able to see and climb the Rock of Horeb, see the Golden Calf Altar, see the Red Sea crossing and climb the cave to where Elijah purportedly stayed (you MUST wear proper hiking shoes for this part, otherwise it's fairly dangerous in my opinion). If you are looking to climb up Mount Sinai, be aware this will take a full day (will take about 8 hours or so) so factor this when booking. 

The accommodation for the two nights were perfectly adequate. We went to excellent places to eat (lunch, breakfast and dinner) and the team knows their stuff. Not one of the places we went to were bad! They were excellent. I had only been in the country for 2 days prior and was actually disliking Saudi already due to some issues, but the tour and company I was with was so fun, that my mood changed and started to enjoy Saudi Arabia. 

All in all, very happy! All attendees on the tour were Christian, but you don't need to be Christian to attend. I think even simply if you enjoy history, you will definitely find it intriguing.

For Chinese Christians or Chinese readers in general, I have written a translation.

有一些报道证明真正的西奈山（摩西山，Mount Sinai）是在沙特阿拉伯。看到这些证据后，我在网上搜索相关的旅游公司资料。最后，对比每家公司的行程和价格，我选择了 性价比最高的 Desert Paths for the Land 三天两夜的旅行团 (Midian tour)。

Gabriel 是该旅游公司的老板。我所有的行程安排都是直接和Gabriel沟通。刚开始我们的交流出现了一点问题，之后所有事情都一切顺利。

这次旅行团的行程和时间规划十分地合理。可以看得出有丰富的带团经验，所以才会这么地顺利。

我们每到一个地方，都会向我们读一段相关的圣经出埃及记 （Exodus，Bible)。 这次行程里，我们看了金牛犊（the Golden Calf Altar) 和红海 （the Red Sea crossing)，还爬了何烈的磐石 （the Rock of Horeb）和 以利亚洞穴 （Cave of Elijah)。在去以利亚洞穴的时候，最好记得带雙登山鞋，不然会很危险。如果你打算去登西奈山（摩西山，Mount Sinai），这会是一天的行程，大概8个小时左右。

在住宿和吃的方面，两晚的住宿都十分的舒适。从早餐到晚餐，带我们去了不同的地方和饭馆尝试当地特色美食。

我提前两天来到沙特阿拉伯。因为一些原因，我当时不太喜欢这个国家。经过了 Desert Paths for the Land 三天两夜的旅行团 (Midian tour) ，我的看法和心情有了一些改变，我开始喜欢沙特阿拉伯这个国家。

总的来说，这次旅行让我感觉轻松和开心。我们这次的团友刚好全都是基督徒。Midian tour同时也欢迎有其他宗教背景或者没有宗教信仰的人参加。如果你只是单纯地喜欢考古和历史，我相信这个旅行团会引起你的好奇心，让你觉得很有趣。",https://ar.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g679581-d23606143-Reviews-Desert_Paths-Tabouk_Tabuk_Province.html,,,+966 50 714 5224,"‪Tabouk Street‬ 12217, تبوك 47311 المملكة العربية السعودية",https://www.desertpaths.co/,19

Ghars Well,مواقع تاريخية,4.5,en,,,,"During our recent visit to Madina with family, we had the opportunity to visit the historic Ghars Well, in Arabic بئر غرس. This well holds great significance as it is where the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) once drank from and requested to be bathed with its water after his demise. It stands out as one of the few historical sites directly connected to the life of the Prophet Muhammad. The Ghars Well complex has undergone recent renovations, with upgrades to the outer enclosure walls, the addition of a small mosque to the north, and the installation of a small sabil (drinking water taps). For safety reasons, a metal grill now encases the well, preserving its historical and spiritual importance for Muslims. Convenient parking is available nearby, and informative hoardings provide visitors with photos and descriptions detailing the significance of this sacred place.","Arabia. It is considered one of the most important historical sites in the city and is revered by Muslims as a significant place in the early history of Islam.

The well is said to have been dug by the companions of the Prophet Muhammad and is believed to have provided them with water during their stay in Medina. According to Islamic tradition, it was at this well that the Prophet Muhammad and his followers took refuge during their migration from Mecca to Medina.

Aside from its historical significance, Ghar'a Well is also significant due to its architectural style and design. The well is made up of a series of interconnected underground chambers, which were designed to store water and protect it from the elements. The walls of the chambers are made of dressed stone and the well has a distinctive, domed roof that is made of brick.

Visitors to Ghar'a Well can still see the remains of the well and its surrounding structures, which have been partially restored in recent years. The site is open to visitors and is a popular destination for tourists and religious pilgrims alike.

In conclusion, Ghar'a Well is a unique and important historical site in Medina, Saudi Arabia, that has great significance for both its historical and architectural value. Its status as a place of refuge for the Prophet Muhammad and his followers during their migration makes it a revered and sacred site for Muslims, and its distinctive design and architecture make it a fascinating place to visit for visitors of all backgrounds.",https://ar.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298551-d25313546-Reviews-Ghars_Well-Medina_Al_Madinah_Province.html,39.60245,24.467213,+966 800 850 1526,"‪CJWG+3VG, Ali Ibn Abi Talib‬ Qurban, المدينة المنورة 42316 المملكة العربية السعودية",http://welcomesaudi.com/,2

Haya Tour,جولات مشاهدة المعالم,4,en,Very bad experience. I used to travel private boat. No boat server  proper time. No infomation centre,,,"We went to the Edge of the World with Haya Tour and had a great time. Our tour guide was very energetic and took some great photos of us. She gifted us some wonderful dates and was very accommodating (e.g., she had a power bank for our phones, she was very flexible when we shifted our drop off point, and she always made sure that we were comfortable with the amount of walking while we were on the tour).

We took a private tour and were picked up from our hotel around 7:00am. We were back in Riyadh by 11:30am. 

The only reason that I didn’t rate this tour as excellent is because it was incredibly difficult to plan this with Haya Tour. I specifically wanted to support this company as it’s owned by a female, so I probably went out of my way to see if we could book a tour with them. They didn’t respond to my inquires via their website and only responded to one of my WhatsApp messages, but didn’t answer beyond that. I even had a friend reach out on my behalf and it wasn’t helpful at all. It was really disappointing. 

I had reached out to other companies and was about to book with them, but Haya Tour finally responded to yet another friend that had reached out to them via WhatsApp. I’m glad that they did as the tour was excellent, but the level of effort that it took to book the tour was unbelievable. I hope that this changes in the future so that others are able to easily experience the hospitality and enthusiasm of their guides.","I was very fortunate to have Haya tours show me around during my short visit to Riyadh and experience the major changes since I was last in Riyadh over 25 years ago.My time was limited as I was en-route  from Australia , but their help and professional expertise ensured I saw the major items of interest.

‪Shaza Afiya Spa and Wellness Center‬,جولات لعدة أيام,4.5,en,,,,"Exquisite tour of ancient Arabia using reservations with Experience Al Ula.
Our Landover tour started at Hegira visiting Hinat bint Wahab reconstruction in purpose minor museum at the south gate welcome center. It is magnificent and intriguing to see the human reconstruction of Hinat, the first ever of a Nabatean resident. The entire reconstruction process is shared along with tomb # 117 where her skeleton was discovered. 
Thereafter, we visited the unfinished tomb of Lihyan son Kuza, often referred to as Madain Saleh. From there to Jebal AlAhmar (Red Mountain) where tomb # 117 is located. 
This was followed by Jebel Ithlib and the Diwan, which is superb, somewhat like a movie set with picturesque mountains that are incredible. Simply beautiful. 
Jebal Banat (Mountain of the Women) that is extraordinary, with permission to enter tomb # 26 to witness how the ancient Nabatean were buried. I was silent for much of the trip as one becomes speechless at the breathtaking views.

The next day was Jebal Khuraibah to see the tombs and excavations of Dadan & Lihyan civilizations that occured before the Nabatean. The lion tombs were resplendent and towering. Then we went across to Jebal Ikmah to view the petroglyphs that is the anciet rock art in the ancient Aramaic language that was before Arabic. It's referred to as the open air library. Our visit to AlUla Old Town was magnificent especially the view from the top of the castle. In summary, these sites are never enough viewing it only once, and therefore repeated visits are enriching and expansive to knowledge of how the Nabatean lived on the ancient Incense Road. It's no wonder that it is a recognized UNESCO World Heritage site.

Saudi Arabia Tours,جولات لعدة أيام,3.5,en,,"I went to Saudi Arabia for a week in January 2022 with my 12 year old daughter. We arranged a day trip to Taif from Jeddah with Saudi Arabia tours, and then a 3 day visit to Al Ula and did the remainder of the itinerary by ourselves. The Taif day trip went quite well. The program was interesting , the guide engaging and the price acceptable given the distances covered. But I expected more from our trip to Al Ula. For instance, Saudi Arabia tours organised a day trip that covers Madain Saleh and Dadan / Jebel Ikmah for US$760 for the two of us ($380 per person). When we did the trip we found that you cannot take your own guide, you can only visit on the organised buses which leave from the winter garden in Al Ula. I now know it is possible to buy tickets on yourself (it is not hard to find the experience Al Ula website) and self organise the day. It costs SAR95 for an adult and SAR45 for a child up to 12 for the Madain Saleh tour and SAR60/30 for the Dadan / Jebel Ikmah tour. So we could have visited for SAR230 if we had known. Thats the equivalent of US$61. It means we paid $700 for the taxi ride to and from the site for the guide to pick us up and drop us off, Saudi Arabia tours also charged us US$400 per night for the accommodation in Al Ula which I later found should have been priced around US$150. And when I asked about activities like the Hidden Valley walk in Al Ula they just said it wasn't available. While there we found an adventure tour operator offering the activity. It was definitely available. The guide we had in Al Ula was a nice man, but he didn't know anything about guiding. When we asked to go to a restaurant for dinner we were taken to a cafe selling croissants and cakes. And in the end he wasn't interested in taking us anywhere, he just dropped us at the adventure tour company so we could organize alternative activities. In total we paid more than US$5,000 for the 4 days itinerary and I can only comment that we were severely overcharged. They even were cheeky enough to ask for more money after we returned home. FYI - Saudi Arabian tours is actually based in Egypt and organizes tours in the region. I do think the guy who organized our itinerary was trying hard and it seemed like we would get the trip we wanted (which is why I agreed to pay so much) but it just didn't work the way they said it would. I don't think this company knows Saudi Arabia well at all and would suggest that if you want a tour, visit the official tourism site for Saudi Arabia and there are many operators to choose from. Apart from the day in Taif which we liked, this was a poorly organised and badly overcharged tour. I cannot recommend this operator at all.",,,"Jeddah(jidá)  é linda e transpira tradição em sua parte antiga,old Jeddah.

He called around trying to find another diver to go with me unsuccessfully.  The website says they have dive masters and instructors, plural, but no one was available.

88 Destinations,جولات لعدة أيام,4,en,"KSA review

The number one rule in business is meeting the expectations that you set. The February 2023 Heritage Tour didn’t do this. There were clues that something wasn’t right even before we all reached Saudi Arabia but I hoped that wasn’t indicative of what lay ahead. 

There’s a lot to see and do in Saudi Arabia but 88 Destinations made it impossible to relax and enjoy it. Constant delays, exceptionally poor organization and logistics, unkept commitments, a lack of local knowledge and poor communication contributed to an anxiety-inducing ‘holiday’. 

I took another company’s tour in Uzbekistan right after this and it was everything the 88Destinations tour wasn’t - efficient, with knowledgeable guides, and respectful of clients’ time and needs. 

Those of us on the Heritage tour began betting each day how late we would start and what the excuses would be. Each day finished a number of hours later than planned, leaving no time to recover. 

I and at least two other passengers were in frequent contact with the agency to request assistance. Instead of correcting the situation comprehensively and right away, half measures were taken and none of them lasted. They compensated through room upgrades and adding a stop or two but we wanted the tour we had paid a great deal of money to take. 

Several times passengers had to take matters into our own hands to make things happen. That simply should never have to happen.

Our tour coordinator, Abdullah, is a very nice man who seems to want the best for his clients. Others in the agency are similarly kind and decent people.

However, this company isn’t ready to do tours. They need to take the time to start over before accepting new clients.",,,Um espaço abandonado que passa agora por uma requalificação com objectivos turísticos bastante pertinentes.

Riyadh Tours,جولات لعدة أيام,4.5,en,,,,"I had to cancel my planned trip to Hong Kong due to the Coronavirus, leaving me with 2 weeks and the need for a Plan B. Saudi Arabia Tours helped me put together an itinerary that met my interests and enabled me to experience the country. I spent a few days in Riyadh, including a fantastic trip to the Edge of the World. Then i flew across the country to Jeddah and drove to Taif and Abha. The guides drove safely and were very accommodating — when we were unable to visit sites on the agenda due to closures, we worked together to come up with alternatives. We also stopped at random places on the road, like a camel milk market and a honey farm. Tourism in Saudi Arabia is in its infancy, so flexibility and an adventurous spirit are necessary. I was satisfied with my choice of 3-star hotels, which were pretty good for that part of the world and had decent breakfast buffets. I would encourage travelers to do their own research and visit places of interest that might not be on the set itineraries. Also, a highlight for me was meeting the extremely welcoming Saudi people, which i did on my own in the evenings. On the whole, i was happy with the services of Saudi Arabia Tours and had a wonderful time on my trip.",They have an on time response to queries. Rokaia their agent’s very helpful.

They arranged 4 SUV cars for us. 4 of us (excluding the driver) sat together in each car. You can swap the car and buddies every day.

4 drivers communicated with digital 2 way radios equipped in each car so every car would be on the same track.

Mohammed is knowledgeable and very calm.
When we came across some issues, he still stayed calm and did his best to fix them.

The accommodation they chose in Alula is amazing. “Sh​alal​ resort”

If she did not know something she was honest & said so but would at the same time look up/ find out that unknown information.
She always had good suggestions & what I really liked is that she asked me for my input & what I wanted to do.
She was also thoughtful & caring & made me want to gladly book again which I will surely do the next time visiting the city.

Jabal Thawr,جبال,5,en,,,,,"This is the cave that the prophet (saw) and his companion (ra) escaped to save their lives while being chased by trackers. It’s a steep mountain. Anyone with back problems of any kind or mobility concerns should not attempt this mountain. It takes 2 hours for an able bodied person to climb and up to 4 hours for anyone else. Rocks are steep and the journey is treacherous winding up the mountain. You are constantly near to cliff edges there are no barriers to stop you falling so you must have good treads on your shoes to grip. You go up and down the same way. Many people will be using the same route as you. There are small hut shops dotted along the route so you can buy water and snacks if yours run out. I highly recommend a sugar fix maybe juice or chocolate to normalise your blood pressure for when you reach the top. There is a snack hut at the top. And no there are no toilets along any of the route. When you reach the top access to the small cave is tiny. Only a few people can fit. There will be a small queue for those wanting to offer prayers inside the cave. Coming down is harder than upwards because gravity will make you go faster. Many people fall and slip on the gravel on the way down. Take it slow. Don’t try and be fast, or smart. You cannot outwit nature. I saw people with diabetes, high blood pressure, old age, mobility issues, cry tears of pain and exhaustion having come so far and have to turn back because the physical pain was just too much to bear. If you have to walk a lot the next day then this uphill climb is not for you. It will leave you exhausted, tired, and ladies will get swollen ankles and feet. Go with a positive mindset. Take it very slow. Good grip shoes or trainers. Take snacks and liquids. Set aside at least 3 to 4 hours uphill. And 2 hours downhill. When you get to the top it is worth seeing and feeling what the Beloved had to go through. A spiritual place indeed. Don’t worship it.

Addas was the slave of Utbah bin Rabiah, who fed the Prophet SAW with grapes when he stopped in Utbah's orchard after he and his companion, Zaid bin Harithah were chased out by Taif's dwellers. Addas was reputed to be the only convert that the Prophet gained during his disappointing Taif visit.

Unfortunately the place was locked and lacked signs of care and maintenance. We were told this is deliberate as there were instances of irresponsible pilgrims coming to perform bid'ah and shirk practices at locations that have historical connections to the Prophet's visit to Taif.

There are still people living around the area, I guess they are migrants who work in the surrounding orchards.",,Algamdulilah what an experience to walk in the footsteps of our Beloved Rasolulah S.A.W.

Madain Saleh Tours,جولات لعدة أيام,4,en,"I visited Alula and took the Maidan Saleh tour. On the tour there was a man that harassed me, he kept taking pictures of me and saying very inappropriate jokes all while I was there with my babies husband and mother. I feel very disrespected and shocked. This man felt that it was ok for him to behave the way he did in front of my my and husband. 

When we complained to the tour guide (Ziad) who also claimed to be a manager, he told us to go to hell and that’s our problem. He made us go sit in the bus and end the tour. Security was called which I thought was going to solve the problem but that wasn’t the case. The man that harassed me, Ziad, and the security guy all worked together as a team, they were all protecting each other. When we realized they were a team, my husband confronted the man that harassed me and he said he was only taking snapchat pictures and it’s not a big deal, he even showed the picture like it’s nothing. The picture had my family in it. I asked for the US Embassy to be called, I asked for law enforcement to be present as we felt unsafe but none of those requests were answered. We were frightened and scared. They basically bullied us for complaining about the man that kept harassing me. 

We waited for them to respond for two hours sitting in the heat with our children. When we went back to Ziad and asked what was going on he told us go walk home if you don’t want to wait. So we paid for a tour in which we were harassed, bullied and trapped. We never got an apology and I don’t think it would help this case at this point. 

We came all the way from America (Denver Colorado) to visit this site and now we feel so disgusted, upset and disrespected. We will never come here again and report this as sexual harassment. We will not recommend this experience to anyone we know. How can a big organization like this have such horrible and unprofessional tour guides. We complained to several people, sent emails and heard nothing. We were not taken seriously at all.

AlUla,جولات لعدة أيام,5,en,,,,,"When we planned to visit Al Ula we decided to stay here for three nights, but it would have been better to stay a little longer. We arrived here by car, which is essential for a complete and independent visit. The main reason tourists come here is Hegra, which alone is worth a visit than Al Ula. We booked the visits to Dadan & Jabal Ikmah and the Old Town online. For the first one, as well as for Hegra, we parked in Winter park while for the second one we used the Old Town North Parking although we can also confirm that Old Town South Parking is closer to the starting point of the tour. The walking tour of the oasis (oasis trail) can be started from several points even if we have considered the best solution to use the car parking located on the other side of the road at the south end of the Old Town.  Among the things to do at sunset without a doubt Elephant Rock and the Harrat viewpoint are unmissable. Al Ula offers many other opportunities for visits and recreation and among them Rainbow Rock and Maraya cannot fail to be mentioned for its uniqueness. Finally, although now temporarily closed, work has begun to expand and repopulate the Sharaan Nature Reserve where in addition to the present animals (red-necked ostriches, regal Nubian ibex, gazelles and Cape hare) the leopard will be reintroduced. We cannot fail to report the kindness and courtesy of those who live here (who have always supported us with information and suggestions), the ease of movement with car and parking and the absolute safety of this town whose only negative aspect (at least one there must be) are the speed cameras.

Al-Dwaihra Mosque,مواقع دينية ومقدسة,5,ja,,,,,"日本から現地ガイド付きのツアーで訪れました。アル・ザウィハ・モスク(Al Dwaihra Mosque)は、「サウジアラビアの真珠」と呼ばれるディルイーヤ(Ad Diriyah)の、アル・ブジャイリ(Al Bujairi)地区にあります。リヤド中心部から北西約20kmに位置します。ワディ ハニファ(Wadi Hanifah)という渓谷に細い川が流れており、対岸はサウード王朝最初の首都でサルワ宮殿 (Salwa Palace)などがある世界遺産のアル・トライフ(Al Turaif)地区です。
川岸はナツメヤシが多く植えられ緑化されており、ピクニックができるような公園となっています。付近の日干し泥煉瓦造りの建物は美しく修復され、地面も石のタイルで覆われ、埃っぽさがまったくありません。モスクの周囲は細い路地となっています。

訪問した時は閑散としており、平日で誰一人いない状態でした。サウジアラビアでは観光地ごとにイベント時期が設定されており、ディルイーヤ シーズン(Diriyah Season)は11月から12月(前回は22 Nov 2019 - 21 Dec 2019)で、普段公開していない遺跡や施設を観ることが出来ますので、この付近を訪問するには最適な時期となります。Al UlaのWinter at Tantora Season 2 (19 Dec 2019 - 7 Mar 2020)の終わり近くに訪れましたので、ディルイーヤではイベント時期でなかったことと、ちょうどクラシックカーのイベント準備で周囲が封鎖されていたこともあります。
公園内やモスク入口にわかりやすい看板などが無いので、アル・ザウィハ・モスク (Al Dwaihra Mosque)には、アラビア語が分からない場合ガイドがいないと訪問は難しいと思います。係の方に中に入れて頂き、ガラス越しに室内を見学しました。

スンナ派の宗教学者ムハンマド・イブン・アブドゥルワッハーブ(Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab)は、1744年にディルイーヤのイブン・サウード(Ibn Saud)に迎え入れられ、教えを広めました。アル・ザウィハ・モスク (Al Dwaihra Mosque)がいつ建てられたかは不明ですが、かなり古いものです。サウジアラビアの10個に分類された歴史的モスクの建築様式ではナジド様式(Najdi Style)と、Abdullatif Al Fozan Awardの""Historical Mosques in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: Investigating Architectural Styles Typology""で解説されています。10個の内、今回の旅行で他にMimar MosqueとUmar Ibn Al Khattab MosqueとShafe’i Mosquesも訪れており、短期間で代表するモスクを目にできたことが嬉しく感じました。さらにAbdullatif Al Fozan Awardのサイトには、モスクの建築情報を網羅した「モスクペディア(Mosqpedia)」があり、「Dwaihra」で検索すると写真やDrawingsを参照でき、建築好きにとっては大変貴重なサイトです。

また、モスクの修復前の写真を探していたところ、The Royal Commission for Riyadh City(RCRC)のサイトの、Publications内に「Al-Bujairi…Heart of the Call」というアル・ブジャイリ(Al Bujairi)に関する情報が網羅されている134ページの出版物があり、エジプトの建築家Hassan Fathyが1960年代に撮影したモスクの写真が修復後の写真と共に載っています。他にもレンガや修復後の天井が確認できる写真、当時をイメージしたイラストなどもあります。モスク名は「Al Dhuwayhirah mosque」で記載されています。RCRCのサイトにはリヤドに関する資料が大変充実しており、サウジアラビアに関する出版物はまだ少ないので非常に参考になります。ちなみにアラビア語と英語のバージョンがあります。

モスクの修復前の写真を見るまでは、サウジアラビアの遺跡の修復方法は経年を感じさせない程きれいに直し過ぎると思っていましたが、建築方法が日干し泥煉瓦が基本のシンプルな工法なので、劣化した部分を直し通行可能な状態に修復すると、このように綺麗に直すしか方法が無いのだとよく理解できました。このような誤解を防ぐ為に、現地に修復前の写真を掲示して頂けると一目瞭然なのでわかりやすいと思います。",https://ar.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1889404-d23146323-Reviews-Al_Dwaihra_Mosque-Diryah_Riyadh_Province.html,46.57528,24.73679,,"‪Al Imam Abdulaziz Ibn Mohammad Ibn Saud, Al Bujairi, Ad Diriyah‬, الدرعية 13711 المملكة العربية السعودية",,1

The House Of Syeda Fatima Bint Al-Husayn,مواقع تاريخية,4,en,,,,"When visiting Makkah and Madinah, our purpose extends beyond performing Umrah and offering prayers at the Prophet Muhammad's (PBUH) mosque. We are drawn to these sacred cities by a desire to explore their rich religious, historical, and cultural significance, steeped in the spiritual aura of Islam. During our recent visit to Madinah, we had the privilege of visiting the house of Syeda Fatimah bint Husayn, a place deeply entrenched in history. She built this house and a well inside it when she moved from her grandmother Fatima's (RA) house. This move was necessitated when Fatima's house became part of the expanding Prophet's Mosque. Syeda Fatimah remained in Madinah while her father participated in the battle of Karbala, where he ultimately met his martyrdom in 110 AH. Fatima was also present in Karbala and was later taken as a captive to Kufa and then to Damascus, along with other members of Imam Hussain's family.

The house is privately owned and lived in by Dr Sami Angawi and his family.
Dr Angawi was born in Mecca and is an authority on Saudi Arabian architecture. The house is called Al Makkiyah and was 10 years in the making.
Dr Angawi built his house according to the wind. Capturing the wind from the north to the west, the house uses natural ventilation for half  of the year, throughout  different levels, limiting the need for air conditioning 
The house is constructed from many locally sourced materials. Dr Angawi’s wife Amira is an interior designer and whenever you see interior photographs of the house, you can see just how talented she is.
I discovered that the house is only available for visits and viewing at particular times and for group tours.
There was no such opportunity when I was in Jeddah, other than admiring the exterior of the house.
The research I did allowed me to discover that when there are opportunities for visits to the house the tickets cost around 200 riyals, which I believe includes tea being served to you.
It is difficult to find information on how you obtain tickets to see the house, if indeed this is still possible.

I’m a fairly experienced kayaker in seas, lakes, rivers and rapids and this is the first time I have been discriminated against because of my size. (I would say I’m small-mid fat, US size 16-18) The member of staff told me and my whole group that I should use a double kayak “because of my weight” but didn’t back this up with an explanation. Maybe the kayaks here are cheaper and less sea worthy than others I’ve used previously. I did it anyway to save embarrassment and time because the process of getting us on the water was very slow. As it happened, the girl who shared with me was much smaller and the weight distribution was completely wrong due to this being a double kayak. I felt unsafe the whole time but luckily, as mentioned I am experienced and a very strong swimmer.  Then we had a great time all kayaking together and swimming together, but at the end another member of staff suggested we set up a photo for breast cancer awareness and told us to “form the shape of a ribbon with our kayaks”. She had no idea how to direct this and expected us to just know how to make the shape she envisioned with no help or leadership. We tried for about 10 minutes but all ended up very frustrated and cranky because we couldn’t get this task right. Then we had an equally slow process of getting out of our kayaks as we had getting in them.

There was a clear path from the visitor center and well-constructed steps to reach the Lion’s Tomb, but the authorities must think that tourists would be irresponsible or incapable of walking uphill for 5 minutes.  The guide provided binoculars to see the tombs better, but it wasn’t so impressive from so far away, after already seeing the Nabatean tombs at Hegra the day before.

Although many people would expect to see the Lion Tombs, you can only see from far away and there are binoculars to help you see clearer. I hope in the future the path you can get closer to the tombs will be open for tourists.

I quite enjoyed the tour because the guide explain the history and about the site. At this time she told me that only about 10% of the site has been excavated. There’s still no museum in AlUla.

Secondly we were taken through numerous screens very quickly so much so that we couldn’t even absorb the information provided. 
We were not allowed to take any pictures throughout the entire tour. 

I was expecting it to be a little bit more relaxed where either we were given the choice to navigate through the screens so that we can attain knowledge on a specific topic. Sadly we were not allowed to touch any of the screens.  

Felt like the host/speaker was on a timer. As we managed to complete the tour in 25 minutes.

Muvi Cinemas,دور سينما,3,en,"Cinema was Hot, probably they want to reduce electricity.
Soda drinks were flat, and gas was more than the soda syrup.
Popcorn dry and hard. 
Some seats are broken, they didn’t repair it nor block it so it won’t be sold.
Toilets are getting old and requires maintenance and parts
Snacks line is ridiculously LONG. You have go come very early to avoid missing the opening of the film
I suggest the VIP experience in any Cinema.",,,"Muvi Cinemas opened its first location in Saudi Arabia in Mall of Arabia. It's the second cinema to open in our city, which opened this August to a great fanfare after months of anticipation. The cinema is beautifully designed with large and welcoming entrance. There are plenty of counters at the snack bars so the lines are considerably shorter than the ones in VOX Cinema in Red Sea Mall (there is an inevitable comparison to me made here), but when it comes to the snacks themselves, I find them good but not great. In my opinion, the snacks at VOX are much better to be honest.    

The attitude of the employees is also indications of how extensive they were trained, as it make you feel they are trying to ensure the moviegoers have a pleasant experience every time. They are greeting their customers with welcoming smile upon their arrival and even when they leave. 

There are 15 screens in total: one landmark  Xperience screen with 400 seats and equipped with Dolby Atmos sound system, the first Screen X in the country, 3 luxury Suites screens, 1 Junior screen, and 9 standard screens. I have experienced the the Xperience, Screen X, and the standard screens, and my experience was very good most of the times. The seats are lavish and comfortable and there is enough space between rows for maximum comfort, the seat recline when you sit back which I personally don't like but many people love this feature. The sound system is great and the projection is clear and crisp. They also have the edge on VOX right now because customers don't have other options than online booking, as you can get your ticket from the box-office in the cinema itself (providing the screening you want is not already fully booked). That said, I find their website inferior to VOX's and there are many booking error it happen during the checking out process, plus as of now, they don't have a mobile app, which can be frustrating.

Overall, it is a great start and a welcome addition to the cinema scene in the Kingdom, but there is a room for improvement for sure, and I hope they keep working on that.","very good popcorn and movie but people are talking  a lot but gotta say very good 5 stars

Snow City,مراكز ترفيه وألعاب,3.5,en,,"We went to snow city today with my 2 children and husband. We were disappointed to find out the 2 year old was not able to join because there were no suits his size. My husband and I decided he would go in with our 6yr old while I wandered about the mall for the 2 hrs. After wandering around the mall for some time I decided to head back up to snow city and get my 2 yr old a snack and we would watch the rest of our family through the window while he ate. We saw other families were sitting up at tables and chairs directly in front of the large window and so we also sat here assuming it was for snow city and people that may be waiting on family. As the cafe next to it was closed and there was no signage, I and the other 4 people assumed this would be fine. 15 mins later my 2yr old is enjoying his lunch and the other people had left their tables. It was at this point I was aggressively approached by a man that worked at the cafe Roti Mum (embroidered tshirt) located within the snow city complex. Never have I been approached in such a disgusting vile manner. He was extremely aggressive in yelling at me that the table I was sitting at was only for patrons of Roti Mum Café. Despite the disgusting way he addressed me, I clarified that the seats were not for snow city  to which his was response was "" where are you from? Do you speak English? Do you understand? "" you leave"" you put this in ?#&#^"" I am from Australia and did not appreciate the patronising condescension. Once I pointed out that my husband was in snow city (he had seen the commotion and had walked over to the window) he was very quick to back off. Absolutely disgusting, this man was also an expat (Indian at a guess) and to be so aggressive in front of a toddler. Being Australian, we of course put rubbish in the bin, my son had not finished eating and there were no signs to indicate the tables were allocated to Roti Mum Café (ironically we had intended to try this cafe when it opened. Won't be doing that.) Mosin or Moishin is what he told me his name was. This unfortunately ruined what started off as an enjoyable outing to snow city.","Over all good different experience, pricy with a time limit  they provide u with ski clothes gloves helmet and shoes for kids make sure u take the right helmet  , reception  is so friendly  i bought my ticket a head , they have not bad offers, changing arena is small the bathrooms smelly and dirty , in the snow land unfortunately their are no signs that says where the game starts and u might go on line and when u reach there they ask u to get a board from down, no direction signs or lightning men are more friendly than the ladies in the arena , unorganized , the ice is ruff for playing they have a laser show fun for 5 and below , over all different nice experience but watch out for safety after 2 hours it gets very cold u cant feel ur nose nor ur hands 2 hours is more than enough for all games",Children loved it.

King Abdulaziz International Airport,متاجر المطارات,2,en,"this is the worst most horrible airport in the world. i was on a flight from hungary to saudia arabia, and had a connecting flight to delhi. everyone on this flight was transferring onto another flight, and had also been told due to the stopover being less than 12 hours they wouldn’t need a transfer visa. upon arrival at the immigration we all get told this is incorrect, and given no information as to why. we get told if we want to make our connecting flight we have to pay $120 dollars for a visa! the people on the desk were arrogant and rude and me feel unsafe and unwelcome in their country.","رغم اهمية المطار و كونه من الطراز العصري الحديث, الا انه يفتقد الى ابسط الخدمات و خاصة لمسافري الترانزيت: لا يوجد كراسي مريحة قبل الدخول الى منطقة الصعود و حتى الكراسي الموجودة تعد على الاصابع. المراكز التجارية تكاد تكون منعدمة و المطاعم قليلة. كما ان التكييف جدا بارد داخل المطار و ليس مريح وكانك داخل الى ثلاجة.","grandioso, talvez precise de um pouco mais de humanidade
há gentileza no tratamento com os viajantes
a distribuição dos banheiros é confusa e pode levar a erros
se houvesse, mereceria um ""bom"" na avaliação","Stayed here twice. The airport has a good business class lounge with a fair variety of food choices. 

On our return flight we checked out to visit the city. It was nice to see the aquarium within the airport. It is reported to be the largest airport aquarium in the world. The aquarium has various species of marine life including sharks.

 Visitors can also walk through a transparent tunnel that runs through the aquarium offering a close-up view of the underwater world.

The airport is very good. 
It has 24hs food services, many toilets and acceptably clean (maybe this is what falls short, many times there is a bad smell, even though there is a staff assigned to each toilet) translator.",https://ar.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295419-d25303306-Reviews-King_Abdulaziz_International_Airport-Jeddah_Makkah_Province.html,39.167107,21.683285,+966 9200 11233,جدة المملكة العربية السعودية,https://www.jed-airport.com/,37
